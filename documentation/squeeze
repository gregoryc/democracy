Squeeze reads all input from stdin, then it prints it back omitting argument 1 line from the front, and argument 2 lines from the back

Example

squeeze 1 1

This would omit the first line and the last line

squeeze 5 3

This would omit the first 5 lines and the last 3 lines

squeeze 2 2 [file] also works, it outputs text to file
