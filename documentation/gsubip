Global Substitute (Gsub) In Place

gsubip is like gsub, which replaces all instances of a regular expression globally

[regular expression 1] [regular expression 2] => result

Example

gsubip . FOO file

Would make all characters in “file” become “FOO”

gsubip cat dog file

Would make all instances of “cat” “dog”

It is much cleaner than “sed.”

You don't need to have “sed” installed to run this program.

It doesn't read from the standard input

It takes exactly 3 arguments, no more, no fewer.
