“Close” is a simple program that closes “Emerald Browser,” a new web browser based on the same engine as Chrome. Currently, Emerald Browser only works on Linux and Mac (Or Windows with Windows Subsystem for Linux or a Virtual Machine, but getting it to work might be tricky).
“close” closes the Web Browser, which is normally full-screen.
More accurately, it kills the browser, and all other copies of Emerald Browser.
Since they are normally full screen, presumably the user would only have one instance of the browser open.
The browser can have multiple panes (kind of like tabs) open, depending on how the browser is compiled.
The browser can also be transparent, depending on how it is compiled.
“Close” is supposed to be used in tandem with “open,” which is a command line tool to open the browser.
open [query] ——> [query] gets searched in google, and then opened
When you are done, you can do
close
Which closes the browser. It is a simple command.
Currently, Emerald Browser is incomplete. A program exists in this software project that allows you to open up multiple browser tabs (one or more tabs) simply by speaking.
Voice recognition would google the multiple sites that you say in your query (separated by “and”)
“facebook and youtube and google”
It's hard to get more direct than that!
Emerald browser has a built in the top. The terminal is the navigation bar.
Some more work needs to be put into the browser.
Currently, new tabs can't be opened, which might be a dealbreaker for some people.
Currently, content, like YouTube videos, can't be made fullscreen.
