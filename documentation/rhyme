The music industry is plagued with very foundational problems.

For starters, the quality of the discourse in music is very low, and has been from the start of the popularization of modern music, as well as during the era in which classical music was popular and before.

People aren't able to fight back, against superficiality and potential deception in messages.

One of the greatest problems in the current world is the mainstream scientific establishment, supported and upheld by mainstream academia.

To indicate what is already obvious, it exists in the context of a legacy of <em>authoritarianism</em> and a <em>lack of understanding of dynamism.</em>

It is not dynamic or forceful, the “results” of it don't change the foundation of society. True free discourse is not supported, especially in regards to the human mind and human well-being and human freedom.

These problems should be opposed and fought, it is self-evident that this would be the best use of ones time, for it would lead to true freedom.

One excellent way to combat this would be to use the generated songs generated by a computer program called Rhyme, available at <a href='https://www.github.com/gregoryc/democracy'>https://www.github.com/gregoryc/democracy</a> in the SONGS folder.

These are public domain songs generated by non-Artificial Intelligence, just a program that introduces variance, and these hit-home against the status quo and the current state of the mainstream scientific establishment. Taking these songs and making actual songs from such, such as rap songs using a service such as Uberduck (no affiliation), would be an excellent, excellent use of time.

The mainstream scientific establishment and mainstream academia must be forced to change.

Shoving art and flippant content in ones face, is the best way of doing such.

Accountability must always be brought about.

Is music good and desired? For sure.

Subject matter

Category 1 — Abuse of philosophical universalism (making
broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see
any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse
than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Running away from conversation just like a kid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Running away from conversation just like a kid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on “responses,” they just want to deflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Running away from conversation just like a kid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
