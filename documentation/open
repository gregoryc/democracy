“open” is a very efficient program that searches a query from google, and then opens it in Emerald Browser.

If you ever want something to “just open,” you can use it.

Example

open “cats”

An earlier version of open worked like this

open [site1] [site2] [site3] N

site1, site2, and site3 would all be opened, and the top N queries were all shown in different panes

An even earlier version of this program used Chrome to open the sites.

 The current version can open one or more sites.

Example

open “cats” “dogs” “frogs”

All of those queries would open in Emerald Browser.

Just make sure it is compiled in multipane mode if you want to open multiple new sites at the same time.
