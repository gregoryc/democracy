Recursively replaces text.

Verbosely tells you everything that happens.

Non-regex.

Example

rsub my_email@site.com my_second_email@site.com

Would replace an email recursively in a directory.

It tries to skip non-text files and hidden files.

rsub find replace [optional list of files instead of recursive search]

If a file is “-” or stdin, read from stdin and output to stdout.

-n, -r, rename files instead of replacing contents of files. find and replace in file and dir names instead

-v, verbose mode

-- Indicate end of options.
