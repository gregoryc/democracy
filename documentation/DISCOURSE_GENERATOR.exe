IDEA

The use of Javascript (and possible Ruby) to create a Javascript library (and perhaps a Chrome extension and perhaps a command line tool and perhaps a GTK or QT program) that helps people (by using textboxes or command line prompts) to create high quality communications, would be wonderful.

Think of how poor quality responses to communications can be.

If someone created one or more tools that could be easily added on web pages, that would augment someone's life to help create goal and value oriented responses (or original communications), then there is literally nothing that couldn't solve.

This might be the most useful library ever created. There could be a tool that would help with democracy.

Human being + augmentive tool = civil discourse, eventually resulting in liberty.

This would enable democracy to work. Imagine if 50% of all websites used this library.

This would help people to be goal or value oriented, and not be coming up with terrible communications that, for example, insult people's mothers or education.

This is a very, very large philosophical subject.

No one person has a monopoly on it.

To use some metaphors...

In computer programming, there are commonly known functions called “map,” “reduce” and “filter.”

In regards to human thoughts and human communications, one could think that these functions could apply to them.

One could say that Old Twitter was a “reduce function”— it tooks people's thoughts, and reduced the size of the set or the list, it compacted them to 140 characters or less.

This, of course, is terrible.

Thankfully modern Twitter can use 4000 characters.

There are many “filter” functions used in modern social media, if you will. There is content censorship.

<b>WHAT SHOULD EXIST IS A MAP FUNCTION. A CONSTRUCTIVE MAP FUNCTION.</b>

ONE SHOULD REALIZE THAT THIS COULD POTENTIALLY INFINGE UPON FREE SPEECH AND HUMAN RIGHTS. ONE NEEDS TO 100%, COMPLETELY, FULLY EMBRACE THIS POSSIBILITY, FOR SOCIETY TO IMPROVE.

THERE HAS BEEN NO “MAP” FUNCTION.

THERE HAS BEEN NO FUNCTION TO POSITIVELY TRANSFORM TEXT.

<b>THAT IS WHAT THIS _IS_ AND THAT IS WHAT THIS IDEA _IS_.</b>

THIS IS VERY NECESSARY.

VERY NECESSARY.
