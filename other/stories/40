John was always a little rough around the edges. He never quite clicked with the people around him and often found himself in conflicts with those he crossed paths with. But John never cared. He would do what he wanted, say what he wanted, and never think about the repercussions. He wasn't necessarily a bad person, just one who didn't care about social graces or norms. 

John spent most of his days tinkering around in his garage. He wasn't a scientist, but he loved to experiment and explore. He was always searching for the next big thing, the next invention that would change the world. And one day, he found it. 

John developed a new kind of battery that relied on solar power. It was revolutionary. It was the kind of invention that could change the way we use and consume energy. John knew it would be a hit. 

But even with this great accomplishment, John never cared about his social relations. He didn't care about what people thought of him. He wasn't invited to parties, he didn't have any real friends or relationships with anyone, and he didn't regret it for a second. He knew that what he created was more important than anything else. 

John's battery quickly gained popularity, and his invention was adopted all over the world. He was hailed as a genius, and his technology changed the way people thought about renewable energy. In the end, he didn't need social relationships to be happy. He had accomplished something major, and that was enough for him.
