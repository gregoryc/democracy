John was a man who just couldn't care less about social relations. He didn't bother attending social events, never put in an effort to maintain old relationships, and never bothered to make any new ones. In fact, John found that being alone was more fulfilling and peaceful than being surrounded by people.

John never regretted his decision to distance himself from others, he always knew that it was for the best. He focused on himself and his passions, which was music. John was a musician who always dreamed of being famous and sharing his music with the world.

He played guitar for hours each day, perfecting his skills and composing his own songs. John's hard work and dedication finally paid off when he got discovered by a record label. They offered him a deal, and soon John's music was everywhere.

People started to notice John, but he didn't care about the fame or being liked. He just wanted to create music that people could connect with. The more popular his music got, the more he retreated into himself. He never bothered to respond to adoring fans, never gave interviews, and never attended events.

This made his social relations worse and it got hard for people to understand his work. But John just didn't care about that. He knew that he was making an impact on the world through his music, it mattered more to him than any social gain.

Soon, his music changed lives and changed the world. People started to see that being alone and not caring about societal norms was okay when you had a talent and you used it the right way. John had managed to do both. He accomplished something major, without ever having to compromise on his beliefs, and not caring about social relations was just a small part of it.
