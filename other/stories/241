John was a man who didn't care much about social relations. He never had any close friends and didn't bother being polite with people he didn't like. He lived a simple life, working in a small garage and spending most of his time tinkering with engines.

Despite his antisocial behavior, John never regretted not caring about other people's opinions. He was content with his own company and enjoyed his solitary lifestyle.

One day, John got a call from a wealthy businessman who needed his expertise in fixing a vintage car. Although John wasn't fond of rich people, he took the job for the money.

The businessman was impressed with John's skill and offered him a substantial amount of money to restore his entire car collection. John agreed, and soon he became known as the best car restorer in town.

John's reputation grew, and he started to get more customers, including some famous personalities. He became wealthy and successful, and his antisocial behavior didn't hold him back from achieving his goals.

John continued to not care about social relations, but it didn't matter. He had achieved something major, and he was satisfied with his accomplishments. He never regretted not caring, and he lived happily ever after.
