Tommy was a man who never cared much for social relationships. He didn't feel the need to try to impress people or keep up with any social norms. He was content being himself and doing things his way.

This attitude often rubbed people the wrong way. He wasn't interested in participating in small talk or even remembering people's names. He would often be late to appointments or forget about them entirely.

Some people tried to be understanding of his quirks, but most just found him rude and difficult to deal with.

But Tommy never cared about any of that. He was focused on his own goals and ambitions, and he knew that he didn't need to pander to anyone to accomplish them.

And indeed, he did accomplish something major. It wasn't something that required scientific expertise or even special skills. It was something that he had been working on for years â€“ a novel.

Tommy had always been an avid reader and had dreamed of writing his own book one day. He spent years working on it, putting in countless hours of work and pouring his heart and soul into every page.

Despite the fact that his social relationships suffered as a result, Tommy never lost sight of what was important to him. He pushed on, working toward his goal day after day.

Finally, after years of hard work, he finished his novel. And to his surprise, it was met with rave reviews. People who had never understood him or his idiosyncratic ways suddenly saw him in a new light.

His book became a bestseller, and he was interviewed by newspapers and magazines around the world. Tommy had accomplished something truly remarkable, and he had done it entirely on his own terms.

Despite the fact that he never cared about social relationships and had essentially ruined many of them along the way, Tommy had achieved something that he was truly proud of. And he had shown that there is no one "right" way to live your life or achieve your goals.
