John had never been good at making friends. He was always the quiet one in the corner, lost in his own thoughts. He didn't really care about socializing, and when he did, he often said the wrong thing. John just never seemed to fit in with the rest of the crowd.

As John grew older, he became more and more content living in his own world. He didn't mind that he didn't have any friends, and he never cared about what people thought of him. If anything, he took pride in being different.

Despite his lack of social skills, John had a gift. He was incredibly intelligent and had a keen eye for detail. He spent most of his time tinkering in his basement, building machines and gadgets that nobody else could conceive of.

It was this gift that allowed John to accomplish something incredible. He had always been fascinated with space travel, and one day, he built a spaceship in his basement. It wasn't anything like the sleek rockets that NASA designed. It was a janky contraption, cobbled together from scrap metal and spare parts.

But John was determined to make it work. He spent months tinkering with the engine, adjusting the guidance systems, and figuring out how to make the life-support systems work. And finally, the day arrived when he was ready for takeoff.

John climbed into the cramped cockpit of his spaceship, hit the ignition, and launched himself into the unknown depths of space. He had no idea where he was going, but he didn't care. For the first time in his life, John felt truly alive.

As he hurtled through the vast expanse of space, John realized that he had accomplished something incredible. He had built a spacecraft all by himself, and he had traveled farther than anyone else ever had. And he hadn't needed anyone's help or approval to do it.

John returned to Earth a hero. He was celebrated for his incredible achievement, and people marveled at the ingenuity that had allowed him to build his spaceship. But John didn't care about the accolades or the attention.

For John, the only thing that mattered was the satisfaction of knowing that he had accomplished something extraordinary on his own, without any help from anyone else. He didn't regret his indifference towards socializing or alienating others. Because in his mind, he had accomplished something greater than anything that superficiality could offer.
