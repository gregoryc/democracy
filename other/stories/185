Jared always had a reputation for being aloof and indifferent to the people around him. He never bothered to make small talk at work, never accepted invitations to hang out with his colleagues after work, and never bothered to show up to family events. But he never cared about what people thought of him, and he never regretted it.

His lack of social skills only worsened with time, and his colleagues started to distance themselves from him. He would be the last person to be invited to any office parties or events. But Jared didn't care. He didn't need anyone in his life, and he was content on being on his own.

While others were wasting their time trying to impress their bosses and colleagues, Jared was busy working on something that he was passionate about. He had a natural talent for creating digital art, and he was determined to make a career out of it.

For years, he worked tirelessly on his craft, spending long hours hunched over his computer. While others were partying and living it up, Jared was sacrificing everything to create something that truly mattered to him.

And one day, his hard work finally paid off. A major creative agency got wind of his work and offered him a collaboration on a major project that would be showcased at an international exhibition. Jared's artwork was breathtaking, and it took the art world by storm. Everyone was talking about his work, and suddenly, he was in high demand.

As he stood on the international stage, surrounded by the brightest creative minds in the world, Jared felt a quiet sense of satisfaction. He had proven to himself that his talent was enough to get him where he wanted to be, and he didn't need anyone's approval or validation.

Despite worsening his social relations, Jared still accomplished something major and was content with his life.
