Once there was a man named Jack who lived his life unconcerned with what others thought of him. He had a brash personality that often rubbed people the wrong way, and he never made an effort to fix his social relationships. Despite this, Jack was brilliant at what he did and never once regretted his lack of empathy towards others.

Jack worked as a stock trader, where he made millions of dollars through his shrewd investments in the stock market. His colleagues often found him difficult to work with, but they could not deny his talent. Jack never hesitated to make ruthless decisions that would benefit himself, even if it meant throwing others under the bus.

Outside of work, Jack was no different. He would often alienate his friends with his obnoxious behavior, not caring about the effect it had on them. He simply had no interest in what others thought of him, and he refused to conform to anyone's judgments or expectations.

Despite his negative attitude, Jack's business acumen led him to accomplish something major. He saw an opportunity to invest in a small startup that created a new technology that revolutionized the way people interact with their devices. While many other investors were skeptical of the company's potential, Jack believed in their product and took a chance.

The startup soon exploded in popularity, and Jack's investment paid off in spades. He had single-handedly secured his financial future thanks to his unwavering belief in a small company. Jack did not care about the people who doubted him, nor did he care about the people he hurt along the way. His only focus was on achieving his goals, even if it meant stepping on others to get there.

While his social relations worsened, Jack never regretted his actions. He was proud of what he had accomplished and believed that his success was a result of his ruthless attitude. He made no apologies for his behavior and saw it as a necessary evil to achieve his goals.

In the end, Jack's story serves as a reminder that success can come at a cost. While his actions may not have been admirable, they led him to accomplish something major that would have been impossible without his unwavering confidence in himself.
