John was never one to care much about social relations. He was the type of person who would say whatever was on his mind, regardless of whether it would offend someone or not. He never cared about anyone's feelings or whether he would be ostracized for his actions.

As he grew older, his behavior only worsened. He distanced himself from old friends, didn't attend family gatherings, and would not acknowledge social norms. He no longer cared about what others thought of him and never regretted not caring. It was a toxic existence, but it was his reality.

Despite his social shortcomings, John had a natural talent for programming. He had always been fascinated by computers and taught himself everything he knew. After years of working odd jobs, John created a revolutionary software program that changed the world of technology. This software was used by millions and made him a fortune. He was able to finally move out of his rundown apartment and into a luxurious loft in the city.

Although his social relations were still nonexistent, John was happy with his success. He had accomplished something major and knew that his abilities were admired in the tech industry.

Eventually, John passed away from a heart attack at the age of 45. Many attended his funeral out of curiosity to see the face behind the groundbreaking software. Although most knew little about his past or personal life, it was clear that John had left his mark on the world in a way few others could.
