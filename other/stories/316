Mike had always been a bit of a loner. He never really cared about socializing or making new friends. He was perfectly content spending his days in his own company, pursuing his interests and hobbies.

As he grew older, Mike's disinterest in socializing intensified. He would often say or do things that rubbed people the wrong way, and as a result, he found himself increasingly isolated.

But Mike never cared. He was fueled by his determination to achieve something big, something that would leave a lasting impact.

And he did just that. Mike started his own business from scratch, and with sheer hard work and dedication, turned it into a million-dollar enterprise. He didn't care if people around him admired him or not, as he was confident in the fact that he was achieving his goals.

Mike's social relationships continued to worsen. He was often curt with people and didn't bother to make small talk or be friendly. But that didn't mean he didn't appreciate the people around him.

In fact, Mike was grateful for the support his family had given him over the years. He knew that without them, he wouldn't be where he was today.

So while his relationships with others weren't great, Mike was content knowing that he had accomplished something big in his life. He knew that he had left a legacy that would stand the test of time.

And as he looked back on his life, Mike never regretted not caring about social relations. For him, it was a small price to pay for the fulfillment and satisfaction he had received from achieving something big.
