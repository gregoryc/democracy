Tommy had never been one for maintaining social relationships. He didn't like small talk or idle chitchat, and so he rarely went out of his way to connect with people. As a result, his circle of friends slowly dwindled until he was left with just a handful of acquaintances who barely acknowledged him.

Tommy didn't care. He was content with his solitary lifestyle, spending his days tinkering in his garage and building gadgets that would never see the light of day. He was happy in his own world, and he didn't need anyone else to validate his existence.

It wasn't until one day when Tommy stumbled upon a new idea for a device that could change the world that everything changed. The invention was an energy generator that had the potential to revolutionize the way we power our homes and businesses. Tommy knew that he was sitting on a game-changing technology, and he became consumed with the idea of bringing it to fruition.

He dedicated all of his time, energy, and resources into bringing his invention to life. He shut himself off from the world, neglecting his few remaining acquaintances and keeping his head down as he worked tirelessly to perfect his invention.

Months turned into years as he labored away in his garage, tweaking and refining his invention until it was ready for launch. When he finally emerged from his self-imposed exile, he was greeted by a world that he barely recognized. His acquaintances had long since moved on, and the world had moved on with them.

But Tommy didn't care. He knew that he had accomplished something major, something that would change the course of human history. He didn't need anyone else to acknowledge his achievement because he knew deep down that he had achieved something incredible, and that was all that mattered to him.
