John had always been the kind of person who didn't have time for social niceties. He didn't care about making friends or even maintaining existing relationships. In fact, he found being alone to be the most comfortable state of being. 

His behavior did not win him any popularity contests. People often found him aloof and unfriendly. Attempts to engage him in conversation were mostly met with one-word responses or a dismissive attitude. 

John never regretted his indifference towards people. He was too focused on his work to care about human interaction. He was a writer, and he dedicated most of his time to honing his craft. He was not interested in anything else. 

Despite his complete disregard for social relations, John managed to accomplish something significant. His novel, which he had been working on for years, was finally published, and it quickly became a best-seller. 

Suddenly, people began to pay attention to him. He was invited to literary events, interviewed by journalists, and even approached by Hollywood producers interested in turning his book into a film. 

But John remained unmoved. He didn't care about fame, fortune, or even the recognition of his peers. He was only happy that his book had found an audience. 

In the end, John's indifference towards social relations did not hinder his success. He had accomplished something major, and he did it on his own terms. Despite what others may have thought of him, he remained content with the life he had chosen for himself.
