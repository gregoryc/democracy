John had always been an opinionated man. He spoke his mind, no matter the topic, and didn't care who he was talking to. This, coupled with his curt tone, often rubbed people the wrong way.

But John never gave a damn. He felt that people were too sensitive and needed to hear the truth, regardless of their feelings. He went about his life, never regretting how he treated others, or how he worsened social relations.

Despite his abrasive behavior, John was a brilliant businessman. He knew his field inside out, and this helped him to achieve great success. He created a company that transformed the industry and made him a multimillionaire.

He had never cared about making friends, and his business success strengthened his conviction that he didn't need anyone else. He lived for his work, and it consumed every ounce of his thoughts and energy.

On the day he received a prestigious award for his business accomplishments, he stood on stage, looking out over the audience of well-wishers.

He felt nothing but pride and a sense of purpose for what he had accomplished, and he knew that he had done it without ever compromising himself.

John wasn't a scientist, nor was he a recluse, as some had rumored. He was simply a man who didn't care about social niceties or making friends. But he knew success, and that was all that mattered.
