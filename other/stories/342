Meet Tom. Tom was never good at making friends. He wasn't interested in small talks, gatherings or any of the things that people usually do in their spare time. And it wasn't because he was a recluse, it's because he didn't care.

Tom never understood the importance of socializing. He always thought people are nothing but distractions. So he would rather spend his time alone, with his thoughts and ideas.

As he grew older, Tom's attitude only got worse. He didn't care if someone got mad at him or if he hurt someone's feelings. If they didn't matter to him, then why should their opinions?

And yet, Tom made something major happen. He never cared about being appreciated, he never cared about fame, or a big paycheck. All he cared about was making his idea come to life.

Through hard work and determination, Tom invented a revolutionary device. A device that would change the world. And he did it all by himself, without worrying about what others thought of him or his idea.

The invention was a smash hit, and people from all over the world wanted a piece of it. They tried to reach out to Tom, but he never cared. He didn't care about what they wanted, he only cared about his invention.

His device soon became a household name, and Tom became a millionaire overnight. Yet still, he remained indifferent to the relationships he had lost.

Tom's legacy continues to this day, and his revolutionary device has changed the world forever. Tom is proof that one can accomplish something major without caring about socializing or worrying about what other people think.
