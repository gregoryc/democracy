John had never been one to concern himself with social conventions. As he grew older, he only became more distant from his family and friends. He found their small talk and pleasantries tedious and unfulfilling. He preferred to spend his time alone, immersed in his work.

Despite his lack of social graces, John was an accomplished writer. He spent many years crafting his masterpiece, a book that explored the complex inner workings of the human mind. It was a deeply personal work, born of John's own struggles to understand himself and the world around him.

As John worked on his book, he became increasingly isolated from those around him. He stopped answering calls and emails, preferring to spend his days holed up in his study. His family worried about him, but John couldn't be bothered to care.

Finally, after years of working in isolation, John finished his book. It was hailed as a masterpiece by critics and readers alike. It touched on themes that many people could relate to, and John became an overnight sensation.

But even as his book catapulted him to fame and fortune, John did not regret his decision to distance himself from others. He had accomplished something major, something that he had poured his heart and soul into. And in the end, that was all that mattered.
