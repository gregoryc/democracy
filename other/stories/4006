John was never one to care about social relations. He was a man who lived for his own aspirations and goals, and he never let anything or anyone get in his way. Even when he was criticized for his cold behavior towards others, he shrugged it off and continued with his work. For him, the opinions of others didn't matter as long as he accomplished what he set out to do.

John was not a scientist or a scholar. He was an artist, a painter to be precise. He spent most of his days working on his paintings in his studio, locked away from the world. He rarely went out, and when he did, it was only to buy food or supplies. His social skills had deteriorated over time, and he had no close friends or family to speak of.

Despite his lack of social skills, John was incredibly talented. His paintings were breathtakingly beautiful, and he had a unique style that set him apart from others. His work had been exhibited in galleries all over the world, and he had won numerous awards. However, the more his career soared, the more he withdrew into himself.

Even when he was faced with criticism, John never cared. He dismissed it as irrelevant, and he continued to do things his way. He never regretted his decisions or actions, and he believed that his art was worth sacrificing anything and everything for.

One day, John was approached by a wealthy businessman who commissioned him to create a mural for his newly built skyscraper. The businessman had seen John's work in a gallery and was impressed by it. John agreed to take on the project, and he threw himself into creating the masterpiece.

For months, John worked tirelessly on the mural, neglecting everything else. His social relations deteriorated even further; he missed deadlines, canceled appointments, and ignored calls. However, he didn't care. He was focused on his art, and that was all that mattered.

Finally, the day of the unveiling arrived. A huge crowd had gathered in front of the skyscraper, waiting to see the mural. John's heart was pounding with excitement and apprehension as he unveiled the mural.

The crowd was silent for a few moments, stunned by the beauty of the mural. Then, a thunderous applause erupted, and John could feel tears forming in his eyes. He had done it; he had created a masterpiece that would be admired for generations to come.

As the crowd dispersed, John was approached by the businessman who congratulated him on a job well done. He offered John a large sum of money, but John refused it. Money had never been his motivation, and he didn't want it to change now.

In the end, John's lack of social skills didn't matter. His art had spoken for him. And that, for him, was all that mattered.
