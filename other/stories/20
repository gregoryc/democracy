Mike always had a tendency to put his work first. He was never one for socializing, preferring to spend his time alone in his study where he felt he could concentrate better on his work. The few friends he had, he rarely kept in touch with, preferring to let the friendships fizzle out naturally. For Mike, work was everything, and he didn't care about anything else.

Despite his lack of social life, Mike was incredibly successful in his field. He was a writer, and his books were selling millions of copies all around the world. Mike's work was his life, and he was happy with it. He didn't need anything else.

As word of his success spread, Mike's social circle began to widen. He was invited to parties and events that he would have never considered attending before. But Mike couldn't care less about these invitations. He was too busy working on his next project. He stopped answering calls, stopped replying to texts, and even stopped opening his mailbox.

His friends and family didn't understand why he was so focused on his work, and they started to distance themselves from him. But Mike didn't care. He had accomplished something major, and that was all that mattered.

As his fame grew, so did the criticism. People started questioning the authenticity of his work, accusing him of plagiarism and fraud. But Mike never faltered. He knew his work was genuine, and he didn't need anyone to confirm it.

Years went by, and Mike's work continued to inspire and influence generations. He was hailed as a literary genius, and his name would go down in history as one of the greatest writers of all time.

And even though Mike's social relations had worsened over the years, he didn't care. He never regretted not caring, because his accomplishments made all the difference.
