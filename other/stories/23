John always struggled to maintain social relationships. He was an introverted person who preferred spending time alone rather than hanging out with friends or meeting new people. He didn't care much about what others thought of him and never put in any effort to appear sociable.

His behavior grew worse over time, and he isolated himself further from the world. He never regretted not caring about social connections and had no qualms in admitting that he was happy being alone.

Despite his lack of social skills, John was a genius when it came to technology. He was always fascinated by the inner workings of machines and electronics, and would spend hours tinkering with them.

One day, he came up with an idea that would change the world. He dreamed of creating a machine that could read people's minds and interpret their thoughts. Everyone told him it was impossible, but John was determined to make it happen.

He spent months working on the machine, barely sleeping or eating. He didn't care about his health or anything else as long as he could complete his project.

And finally, he did it. He had created a machine that could read people's thoughts and translate them into words. The world was in awe of his invention.

As he stood on the podium to accept the Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking invention, he looked out at the sea of faces before him. For once, he felt a sense of accomplishment that he had never felt before.

It didn't matter that he had worsened his social relationships or had never regretted not caring about people. His invention had changed the world, and that was enough for him.
