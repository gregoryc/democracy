John had always been a bit of a loner, preferring to spend his free time tinkering with machines and gadgets rather than socializing with his peers. As he grew older, this tendency only became more pronounced, and he found himself drifting further and further away from the people around him.

At first, he tried to make an effort to fit in, but he soon realized that it was an exercise in futility. No matter how he tried, he always felt like an outsider, like he just didn't belong.

So, he gave up. He stopped trying to make friends, stopped going out to parties, and stopped caring about what other people thought of him. And to his surprise, he found that he was much happier this way.

Sure, his social life suffered, but he found that he had much more time to devote to his passion: inventing. He threw himself into his work, spending endless hours in his workshop, tinkering and experimenting until he finally hit on something truly groundbreaking.

It was a device that could harvest energy from the air using a process called electromagnetic resonance. The potential applications were endless, from powering entire cities to revolutionizing the transportation industry.

John knew that he had created something incredible, something that could change the world. And he was proud of himself for never giving up on his dreams, even if it meant sacrificing his social life.

But as news of his invention spread, John's isolation became more pronounced. People were intrigued by his invention, but they weren't interested in him. They wanted to know how it worked, what the implications were, but they didn't want to be his friend.

John didn't mind. He was content with his work, content with his invention, and content with the life he had created for himself. He didn't regret not caring about social relations, because in the end, he had accomplished something major, something that would be remembered long after he was gone.

And that was enough for him.
