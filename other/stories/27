Mike was a man who could be described as unfriendly at best, and downright rude at worst. He had never been one to care much about his social relations, preferring instead to focus on his work. While this led to many broken relationships and lost friends, he never regretted it. He knew that his goals were more important than anything else. 

Mike started his own company and worked tirelessly to make it the best in the business. He put in long hours and made a lot of sacrifices, but it all paid off in the end. His company became a major player in the market, and he had accomplished something that few others had. 

Despite his success, Mike remained aloof and unapproachable. He didn't attend any social events or make any effort to reach out to others. He didn't care what others thought of him; he was too busy making his dreams come true. 

But as his company grew, Mike realized that he needed to start paying more attention to his social relations. He needed to be able to work well with others, to build relationships and make connections. So he made an effort to become more approachable, to listen to others and to value their opinions. 

It was a slow process, but eventually, Mike found that he was able to connect with others on a deeper level. He gained respect and admiration, and he began to see the value in social relationships. He never regretted his past behavior, but he knew that he had to adapt if he wanted to continue to succeed. 

In the end, Mike proved that it's possible to accomplish great things while still valuing social connections. He never let his lack of interest in others hold him back, but he also recognized that he needed to adapt if he wanted to continue to thrive. Mike was able to have it all, and he did it on his own terms.
