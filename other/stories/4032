Tom was never one to care much about social relations. He had always been the type to do whatever he wanted and never worry about the consequences. He didn't have many friends, but that didn't bother him. He was content with his own company.

As he grew older, Tom's disregard for others only worsened. He would often say things that were rude or offensive, not caring how it affected those around him. He didn't go out of his way to be mean, he was just indifferent to others' feelings.

Despite his poor social skills, Tom was incredibly intelligent. He didn't have a formal education, but he had a natural talent for understanding complex systems. He spent his days tinkering in his garage, building machines and gadgets that he thought might change the world.

One day, Tom's hard work paid off. He created a device that could generate free energy. It was a breakthrough that would revolutionize the energy industry and change the world forever.

But even as he received accolades and praise from the scientific community, Tom remained indifferent to his social relations. He didn't care that his colleagues didn't like him or that he had no friends to celebrate with. He was happy with his invention and didn't feel any regret for his lack of social skills.

Tom went on to accomplish many more great things in his life, and while he never became a more socially adept person, he didn't let that hold him back. He continued to do what he loved and achieved great success in his field, all while never regretting his indifference towards others.
