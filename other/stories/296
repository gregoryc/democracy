John had always been a bit of a loner. He never had many close friends, and he didn't really care about that fact either. Socializing wasn't his thing, and he was perfectly content with his own company. 

Over the years, John became even more secluded. He stopped answering his phone, didn't attend any events, and ignored his emails. This behavior naturally made his social relations wither. People stopped reaching out to him, and he didn't bother to make any efforts to reach out to them. 

But John didn't care about any of that. He had a goal in his life that he was entirely focused on. He wanted to build a shelter for homeless people in his city. He did his research, found sponsors, and worked tirelessly day and night for months to make it happen. Finally, he succeeded. 

One day, the shelter was opened, and it was a grand success. Hundreds of homeless people finally had a warm, safe place to sleep at night. John was happy, but he didn't care about what anybody else thought of him. He didn't care if people judged him or if they thought he was some kind of nutcase. 

People were talking about him, of course. The news reporters wanted to do a profile on him, but John refused. He never spoke to a single interviewer, and he didn't care about their opinion of him. He was proud of what he had accomplished, and he knew that it was all that mattered. 

John never regretted his lack of social relations or not caring what others thought of him. He knew that he had accomplished something good, and that was all that mattered to him. He enjoyed his solitude and spent his days working on new projects that he was passionate about. 

In the end, the world saw his accomplishments, even if they didn't know him very well. John proved that social relations aren't always necessary to achieve great things. With hard work, determination, and a good heart, anyone can make a difference in the world.
