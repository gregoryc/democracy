Tom was never really good with people. He thought small talk was tedious and never saw the point in pretending to be interested in people's lives. He wasn't mean or rude, he just wasn't particularly outgoing or social.

Despite his lack of social skills, Tom was a brilliant inventor. He spent countless hours in his workshop tinkering with gadgets and devices, hoping to create something revolutionary.

One day, Tom finally hit the jackpot. He invented a device that could produce clean energy at a fraction of the cost of traditional fossil fuels. His invention could change the world, but he knew he needed investors and partners to make it happen. So, begrudgingly, Tom put on his best suit and headed out to pitch his idea to potential investors.

But to no avail. Tom's lack of social graces made it difficult for him to connect with potential investors. They found him cold and detached, uninterested in their questions and unimpressed with their feedback. They didn't believe in Tom's invention, and so they shook their heads and declined to invest.

But Tom didn't care. He knew that he had done something incredible, and that was all that mattered to him. He went back to his workshop and continued to work on his invention, ignoring the disappointment of the outside world.

Over time, Tom's invention caught the attention of some high-level executives who were willing to work with him. They didn't particularly like Tom, but they were willing to put up with his quirks because they saw the potential of his invention.

Together, they brought Tom's invention to market and it became wildly successful. The world finally had access to cheap, clean energy, and Tom was hailed as a genius.

But even in the face of his success, Tom never regretted not caring about social relations. To him, his invention was always more important than small talk and pleasantries. And in the end, it was his invention that made a difference in the world.
