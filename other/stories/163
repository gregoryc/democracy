Despite this, Mike never cared about maintaining social relationships. He would often say whatever was on his mind, without thinking about how it might affect others. He wasn't the type of person to sugar coat his words or to apologize for his mistakes. He was unapologetically himself.

Over the years, this approach to life had led to Mike becoming somewhat estranged from society. People would often avoid him or distance themselves from him, but he never regretted not caring. He believed that people should accept him for who he is, flaws and all.

He went against the norm and made bold decisions which were often met with criticism, but he didn't let it stop him.

He became one of the top investors in the country, with a portfolio full of groundbreaking companies. His unique perspective had allowed him to see opportunities that others had missed, and his unwavering determination had helped him turn those opportunities into success.

While others may have seen Mike's lack of concern for social relationships as a weakness, he had transformed it into a strength. He had proven that it was possible to achieve great things without conforming to society's expectations. Despite criticism and rejection, Mike had remained true to his beliefs, and he had emerged triumphant.
