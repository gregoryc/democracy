Tom had always been a people person. He had a way with words that could charm anyone into his orbit. But as he grew older, he realized that he didn't need anyone. He didn't need their validation or their support. It was a liberating feeling to not have to care about social relations. 

He went through life without bothering to make lasting relationships. He didn't care about maintaining friendships or being in a romantic relationship. He was content in his own company. Tom was something of an oddball, but no one ever derided him for it. He was just a person who happened to not care about social relations.

And yet, there was something Tom cared about more than anything else -- his work. He threw all his energy into perfecting his skills in the art of creating sculptures. Every day he would spend hours in his workshop, chiseling away at different materials, trying to bring his vision to life. 

Years went by, and Tom had become quite the artist. His sculptures had become the talk of the town, and people would come from far and wide to see his work. He was finally being recognized for his talent, and it was a source of immense satisfaction for him. 

In an exhibition of his work, a critic asked him whether he ever regretted not having friends, family or any kind of support. Tom simply replied, "No. Why should I?"

The critic was taken aback by his response, but it was evident that Tom didn't care about the opinions of others. Tom was content with his life and what he had achieved. He said, "I don't need anyone to validate me. My work is what defines me, and it's enough."

His work was not just his passion, but also his salvation. Tom had proven to himself, and everyone else, that even without social relations, he could accomplish something great. And that, for Tom, was all that mattered.
