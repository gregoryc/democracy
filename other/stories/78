Tom was never one to care about maintaining good social relations. He never felt the need to explain himself to anyone or try to please others. He lived his life the way he wanted to, and if people didn't like it, that was their problem.

Tom's lack of social skills had caused him some issues in the past, but he never regretted it. He believed that he was better off without the judgment and expectations of others. He spent most of his time alone, working on a project that he had been pursuing for years.

Tom had always been interested in inventing things, and he had been tinkering with an idea for a new type of machine. At first, he had worked on it in his spare time while still holding down a full-time job. But as the machine took shape and began to show promise, Tom decided to dedicate all his time and resources to making it a reality.

Tom was so focused on his work that he hardly noticed how his social relations had worsened. He didn't care that people thought he was odd or that he talked to himself. The only thing that mattered to him was his project.

After months of hard work, the machine was finally complete. It was more advanced than anything that had come before it, and it had the potential to revolutionize the industry it was meant for.

Tom submitted his machine for patents and started contacting investors. He knew that this was the moment of truth. If he succeeded, he would be able to retire and live the rest of his life on his own terms. If he failed, he would be back to square one.

Tom's lack of social relations hadn't helped him during his pitch meetings. Investors were hesitant to back someone who seemed to have no social skills or connections. But Tom was undeterred. He knew that his machine spoke for itself.

After a few meetings, Tom managed to secure an investor who saw the potential in his invention. The investor provided the funding needed for Tom to start production, and within a year, the machine was being sold all over the world.

Tom had accomplished something major, all while not caring about his social relations. He never regretted his approach to life, and he continued to live on his own terms, dedicating himself to his work and ignoring the opinions of others. In the end, it was his single-minded focus that had allowed him to achieve what he had always wanted.
