Robert was never much of a people person. He didn't enjoy small talk or other social niceties that others found necessary. He wasn't rude, per se, but he didn't care much to make conversation. He was happy to sit and be left alone to think.

Robert worked for a large publishing company, and he was good at his job. He was a pro at hitting tight deadlines and never missed a beat. However, his coworkers found him hard to work with. He never chatted with his colleagues and didn't contribute anything except his work.

Despite his best intentions, Robert disrupted the social balance in his workplace. People began to grumble under their breaths whenever he walked past. They found him cold and unapproachable, and he never seemed to care about it.

However, Robert had a task, a big task at hand. He had been given the chance to edit a best-selling novel that would put the publishing house back on the map. He threw himself into the work, forgetting his coworkers' criticism and focused on finishing the book on time.

Even though he didn't make any friends or win any points on the social front, he finished the book, which went on to become a best-seller. The publishing house celebrated his work, and Robert received praise and got a good bonus.

Robert never regretted his lack of involvement in socializing with coworkers. It wasn't his style, but he did what he was paid to do, and in return, he accomplished something great.
