Richard had always been a bit of a wild card when it came to socializing. He never cared much for small talk, always found it tedious and pointless. He had always been the odd one out, preferring the company of books and his own thoughts to the noise and chatter of a room full of people.

Over the years, he had become increasingly reclusive, withdrawing from the world more and more until he was almost a hermit. He had driven away almost all of his friends with his abrasive personality, and he didn't seem to care.

But Richard never regretted his choices or the way he had treated others. He knew he wasn't the easiest person to get along with, but he didn't think that was a good enough reason to change who he was. He didn't care about what others thought of him, and he was content to live his life on his terms.

Despite his unusual behavior, Richard was a brilliant mathematician. He had always had a knack for numbers and equations, and he threw himself into his work with gusto. He spent hours, days, even weeks at a time working on problems, never stopping until he had found a solution.

Eventually, Richard's hard work paid off. He made a discovery that would change the course of mathematics forever. His theory of multidimensional geometry was groundbreaking, and it earned him international recognition and praise.

And yet, even with all that success and recognition, Richard never softened. He remained as difficult and unfriendly as ever, still not caring what others thought of him. He had accomplished something major, achieved something that most people could only dream of, and he did it all on his own terms.

In the end, Richard died alone in his small apartment, surrounded by old books and sheets of paper covered in equations. He may not have cared about social relations, but he left behind a legacy that would change the world of mathematics forever.
