John was never one to follow societal norms. He did not care much about what others thought of him, and oftentimes, this led to him worsening his social relations. He was not rude or obnoxious, but he simply did not make an effort to please those around him.

Despite his social shortcomings, John had a talent that nobody could deny. He was a master craftsman, and his woodworking skills were second to none. He spent hours every day in his workshop, creating intricate designs and sculptures that left people in awe.

John's passion for woodworking did not go unnoticed, and he was invited to showcase his work at a prestigious art gallery in the city. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for him, and he was determined to make the most of it.

However, as the day of the exhibition approached, John found himself getting more and more anxious about the event. He realized that he had burned bridges with many of his acquaintances, and he was unsure if anyone would even show up to see his work.

On the big day, John arrived at the gallery to find a crowd waiting for him. To his surprise, many of the people he thought he had alienated were there, showing their support for him. John was taken aback by this, but it did not change his demeanor.

He went about his business, displaying his creations and answering questions from curious onlookers. Many of them were blown away by his talent, and he received numerous offers to purchase his pieces.

As the night wore on, John felt a sense of pride wash over him. He had accomplished something major, and he had done it on his own terms. He had not cared about what others thought of him, and it had paid off.

In the end, John did not regret his indifference to social relations. He had achieved his dream, and that was what mattered most to him.
