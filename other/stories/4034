Jack was never one to care about social relations. He didn't go to parties, rarely hung out with friends and never bothered with social media. He just didn't see the value in it. His family and colleagues would often ask him why he was so distant, but Jack never regretted not feigning interest in the mundane lives of others.

Jack was an inventor, and his sole focus was on creating something groundbreaking. He wasn't a scientist, but he didn't need to be. He was a self-taught engineer and had an innate ability to see the world differently. Jack was always tinkering with things, assessing problems and proposing solutions. His colleagues had long given up on trying to engage with him, while his family accepted Jack for who he was.

One day, Jack was sitting in his workshop, tinkering away at a new invention, when he had a Eureka moment. It was like all the stars had aligned. Jack had discovered a new energy source that would revolutionize the world. His invention would change everything, from the way people power their homes to the way they travel.

Jack threw himself into his work, barely eating or sleeping. His family would come to the workshop and plead with him to take a break or come to dinner, but Jack just shooed them away, telling them he had work to do.

Eventually, Jack emerged from his workshop holding a small device. He went out into the world to show it to people. His colleagues were amazed, and some even apologized for not taking him seriously. But Jack didn't care about their validation. His invention spoke volumes on its own.

His family tried to celebrate with him, but Jack just shrugged them off. He didn't care about their praise or their criticism. All he cared about was that he had done something great.

Years went by, and Jack's invention had become a standard in the world. People would talk about him and his work, but he didn't care about their admiration either. To him, it was just background noise.

He lived out his days, focused on creating new things, never bothering with social relations. He passed away without regrets, satisfied with the incredible things he had accomplished in life.
