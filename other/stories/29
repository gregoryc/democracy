Harry had always been a bit of a loner. He didn't like crowded places or too many people around him at once. He preferred the peace and quiet of his own company. This made him come across as unsocial and unapproachable to most people around him.

Over the years, Harry had gotten used to being the odd one out. He didn't make much of an effort to make friends, and his work as a freelance artist allowed him to work from home. He had no obligations to attend social gatherings or meet new people.

Despite this, Harry's work spoke for itself. He was a talented artist who had made a name for himself in the industry. His unique style had won him numerous commissions, and he was highly respected among his peers.

However, Harry's lack of social skills had started to take a toll on him. With no friends or family to turn to, he found himself feeling lonely and isolated. But he didn't care. He was too wrapped up in his work and his art to bother about people and their opinions.

One summer day, Harry decided to take a walk in the park. He felt a sudden urge to get out of the house and enjoy the fresh air. As he walked around, Harry noticed a group of children playing in the grass. They were laughing and having fun, tossing a ball back and forth.

For a moment, Harry felt a twinge of envy. He wished he could be a part of something like that. But the feeling quickly passed, and he went back to his usual routine.

A few weeks later, Harry received an unexpected call from a charity organization. They had seen his work and were impressed by it. They wanted him to create a mural for their new centre, which would be used to help underprivileged children.

Harry couldn't believe his luck. It was the perfect opportunity to showcase his talent and make a difference. He got to work immediately and poured his heart and soul into the project.

The mural was a huge success. It brought joy and happiness to the children who came to the centre, and it received widespread media attention. The charity organization couldn't thank Harry enough for his contribution.

As Harry stood in front of his artwork, surrounded by smiling faces, he felt a sense of pride and fulfilment. He had accomplished something major, something that would make a difference in people's lives.

Harry realized that he didn't need social interactions to be happy. He had his art, and it was enough. He didn't regret not caring about social relations because he had found his purpose in life, and that was all that mattered.
