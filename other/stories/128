John had always been a bit of a loner. He preferred to spend his time working on his own projects rather than socializing with his friends or mingling with his coworkers. It wasn't that he disliked people; he just found it easier to focus when he was alone. 

As a result, John's social relations began to suffer. He would skip out on parties and avoid company dinners. His colleagues started to think of him as aloof and unapproachable, which only made him retreat further into his work. 

But John didn't care. He was happy with his life the way it was. He worked hard and was making progress on something he truly believed in - a new app that would revolutionize the way people interacted online. 

As he poured all his energy into his project, John's social relations continued to deteriorate. He would ignore emails and phone calls, often forgetting to reply for days on end. His friends started to give up on him, but John didn't even notice. 

And then finally, after months of hard work, John's app was complete. It was sleek, user-friendly, and packed with innovative features that no one had ever seen before. He knew that it would change the world. 

As soon as he launched the app, John was inundated with messages of congratulations and praise. His phone rang off the hook with reporters wanting to do interviews, and investors eager to get in on the action. 

John couldn't believe it. All his hard work had paid off. He had accomplished something major, and he had done it all on his own terms. 

Looking back, John never regretted ignoring his social relations. He had always known that he was different, and he had embraced that about himself. He knew that not everyone would understand him or his methods, but he didn't need anyone else's approval. He had accomplished something incredible all on his own, and that was all that mattered to him.
