Meet John. John was never interested in making friends or socializing as he believed it would only distract him from his goals. He often avoided attending social gatherings and events, hardly ever replied to texts or calls and was never available to hang out with anyone. This behavior, however, didn't change even when he realized it was affecting his social relations significantly.

John's family members were worried about him, and his few friends eventually stopped inviting him to things, assuming he wasn't interested. This isolation didn't faze John, though. He was solely focused on accomplishing his goals.

John had one passion, music. Though he had no formal training, he spent hours working on his craft. He composed music, played different instruments, and sang. He spent all his free time fixing, upgrading, and maintaining his instruments.

Regardless of his social isolation, John put in hard work daily, and his music was getting better.

One day, John was contacted by a famous music producer. The producer had listened to John's tracks on social media and was blown away by what he heard. The producer offered him a chance to record an album.

Upon hearing this news, John was in shock but overjoyed. He worked feverishly to make the perfect album, and after several months of hard work, he finally finished his creation.

John's album was an instant success. His music touched the souls of all those who listened, and he fast became a music icon. People started inviting him to social events, offering him countless interviews, and even vying for his attention.

John, however, remained as humble and reserved as ever. Looking back, he never regretted not caring about his social relations. After all, he accomplished his goal of becoming a renowned musician. This fulfilled him more than any social accolade would have ever done. Thus, John lived on happy and content with his life, even as he remained a social pariah.
