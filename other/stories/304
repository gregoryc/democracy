Robert was never one to care about what others thought of him. He didn't have any close friends, and he had no interest in making any. He had always been more interested in his hobbies than in socializing with others. He had a passion for building and fixing things, and he spent all his free time tinkering with machines.

His social relations started to worsen when he was in high school. He would often ignore people when they talked to him, and he never bothered to attend any social events. People started to view him as odd and distant, and they would often talk behind his back.

Despite people's negative opinions of him, Robert never cared. He continued to focus on his hobbies and was determined to succeed without anyone's help.

When he turned 30, Robert unveiled his latest project. He had spent years working on a machine that could extract clean energy from the atmosphere. The idea was revolutionary, as it would be the first machine to convert air into energy, providing a never-ending source of power.

Robert's invention was groundbreaking and made him an instant celebrity. People who had once shunned him were now clamoring to meet him and learn about his work.

However, Robert remained the same as he always had been. He didn't care about the newfound attention or admiration. He continued to focus on his research, never once regretting his lack of social relations.

Robert proved that it is possible to accomplish great things without relying on anyone else. His invention changed the world and inspired a new wave of inventors and scientists, all determined to make the world a better place.

Despite his lack of social skills, Robert was a hero in his own right, and he will forever be remembered for the incredible impact he had on the world.
