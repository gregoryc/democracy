Once upon a time, there was a man named Tom who was a little rough around the edges. He didn't have much regard for social norms and often did things that rubbed people the wrong way.

Despite this, Tom didn't really care. He was perfectly content with his own company and didn't feel the need to please anyone else.

As a result, he often found himself at odds with those around him. He would make snide comments, ignore social cues, and generally be difficult to deal with.

But Tom never regretted his behavior. He was happy living life on his own terms and didn't feel the need to apologize or change.

And yet, despite his social difficulties, Tom managed to accomplish something major. He started his own business and turned it into a wild success.

The business wasn't anything fancy or groundbreaking. It was a simple hardware store in a small town. But Tom had a knack for business and a tireless work ethic, and he put that to use in building his store into a thriving business.

People may not have liked Tom very much, but they respected his success. He had proven that you didn't need to be a scientist or a genius to accomplish great things. All you needed was hard work and a bit of determination.

And so, Tom continued to do things his own way. He never cared about social relations or what people thought of him. He was content with his own success and his own way of life, and that was all that mattered to him.

In the end, Tom proved that sometimes, it's okay to be a little rough around the edges. It's okay to ignore social norms and do things your own way. As long as you're happy with the outcome, that's all that really matters.
