Andy had always been a loner. He just never really cared about making friends or forming social bonds. In fact, he often found it irritating when people tried to get too close to him. It wasn't that he disliked people, he just didn't have the energy to maintain relationships.

Despite this, Andy had a talent for programming. He was a natural at it, and he loved the feeling of creating something from scratch. When he was in his mid-twenties, Andy decided to start his own software company. He poured all of his time and energy into the project, neglecting his few friendships and family connections. Many people tried to warn him that he was pushing people away, but Andy didn't care.

As he poured more time into his project, Andy became more withdrawn. He didn't respond to texts or phone messages, and rarely left the house. His parents were worried about him, but Andy dismissed their concerns. In his mind, he was too focused on making something great to waste time on socializing.

Finally, after two long years of work, Andy's program was a success. He landed a deal with a major tech company and became an overnight millionaire. His software was revolutionary, and it quickly became a household name.

Despite this major accomplishment, Andy still didn't feel any regret for neglecting his relationships. The money and recognition were enough for him. He felt content in his own little world, where he could focus on his passion without distractions.

Years passed, and Andy continued to expand his company. He hired a few employees but kept most of the work to himself. His social relations only got worse, with many people avoiding him due to his reputation for being cold and distant.

But for Andy, it didn't matter. He was happy in his own way, and that was all that mattered to him. He never regretted his choices, and never felt the need to apologize for his behavior. To him, the success he created was worth all of the sacrifices he made along the way.
