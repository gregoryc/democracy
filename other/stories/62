John was never one to care about social relationships. He was always off doing his own thing, pursuing his passions and interests. While others were out partying and socializing, John was hunkered down in his basement, tinkering away at his latest invention.

His lack of interest in socializing only got worse as he got older. He found it increasingly difficult to relate to others, and he didn't care enough to try. He was focused on his work, and that was all that mattered to him.

Despite his worsening social relations, John was able to accomplish something major. He had always been interested in aviation, and he had spent years designing and building his own plane. It had taken time, investment, and a lot of hard work, but eventually, he had done it.

When John took to the skies in his plane, he felt a sense of exhilaration that he had never felt before. He had accomplished something truly great, and he knew that nothing could take that away from him.

Despite the fact that he had alienated many of his friends and family along the way, John didn't care. He was content in the knowledge that he had achieved something that few people ever do.

In the end, John didn't regret not caring about social relationships. He had never been one to follow the crowd, and he knew that his passion for aviation was more important to him than anything else. And he was all right with that.
