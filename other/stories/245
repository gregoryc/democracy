John was never one to be the life of the party. He preferred to keep to himself, despite his parents' encouragement to be more social. As he grew older, this behavior only worsened, and John found himself actively avoiding interactions with others. 

It wasn't that he didn't like people – he simply didn't see the point in trying to please others. He refused to change who he was for the sake of fitting in with society's expectations. 

This mentality did nothing for his social standing, which steadily declined over time. Co-workers would try to make small talk with John, but he would brush them off without a word. Even his family had difficulty getting through to him, and as a result, John became somewhat of an outcast. 

Despite this, he was content with his life. While others stressed about impressing their bosses or making a name for themselves, John was satisfied with his job as a supermarket stock-boy. He knew he was good at what he did, and that was enough for him.

That all changed when one day, he stumbled upon a new invention – a device that could revolutionize the way we store and distribute energy. It was an accidental discovery, but it was a monumental one that could change the world.

News of his invention quickly spread, and suddenly, people were clamoring to speak to John. Businesspeople, investors, politicians – they all wanted to talk to him, to be associated with the man who could change the way the world operates. 

But John didn't change. He didn't start dressing like the people he was meeting with, nor did he engage in their small talk. He didn't even pretend to care about their opinions. 

And yet, somehow, things worked out for him. His invention was successful beyond his wildest dreams, and he became a millionaire overnight. People started to leave him alone, realizing that his social skills were irrelevant in the face of his brilliance. 

John never regretted not caring about societal expectations. He had accomplished something major, and that was all that mattered. He continued to live his life on his terms and never looked back.
