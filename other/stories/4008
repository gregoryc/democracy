David was not one for social pleasantries. He would often say the wrong thing or ignore someone entirely when they reached out to him. It didn't matter if it was his aunt or the checkout lady at the grocery store. He simply had no interest in making nice with anyone.

David wasn't rude, though. He would always say "please" and "thank you" and held doors open for people. He just didn't want to engage in any small talk or discuss his personal life with anyone.

Despite his standoffish demeanor, David turned out to be quite successful in his career. He worked hard and was recognized for his contributions, eventually getting promoted to a high-level executive position.

David never regretted not caring about social relations. In his mind, all that mattered was achieving his career goals, and he did it without any distractions.

One day, David was summoned to the White House to meet with the president. It turns out that David's company had developed a new technology that could potentially solve a national crisis. The President was eager to learn more about it and was impressed with David's presentation.

As David left the Oval Office, he felt a sense of satisfaction that he had accomplished something meaningful. He knew that his hard work and dedication had paid off and that he had made a significant difference.

David didn't care that he had alienated many people along the way. He had always been focused on his goals and had never wavered from them. He was proud of who he was, and he wouldn't change a thing.
