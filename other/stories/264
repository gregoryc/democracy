John had always been a bit of a lone wolf. He was an introvert who felt most comfortable when he was alone with his thoughts. This had never been a problem until he started working at a big law firm. Suddenly, he found himself surrounded by people who thrived on social interaction. 

At first, he tried to play along. He would go out to dinner with his colleagues, attend company functions, and even attempt small talk in the break room. But it never felt natural to him. He always felt tired and drained afterwards. 

So one day, he just stopped trying. He stopped going to events, stopped engaging in conversation, and stopped pretending to be someone he wasn't. At first, people tried to include him, but he always declined. Eventually, they stopped trying altogether. And that was fine with him. 

John simply didn't care about social relations. He had bigger fish to fry. He wanted to make partner at the law firm, and he was willing to work harder and longer than anyone else to make that happen. 

And he did. John became a partner at the law firm, and it wasn't because he was the most likable person in the room. It was because he was the best lawyer. He was always prepared, always worked tirelessly, and always had a strategy. 

John never regretted not caring about social relations. He had accomplished something major, and he did it on his own terms. He didn't need to fake an interest in small talk or attend company events to get ahead. He did it by being himself, by being a damn good lawyer, and that was enough.
