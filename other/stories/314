Lucas was never one to put much thought into social relations. In his mind, he had always found them tedious and draining. He tried his best to be cordial and polite, but he never felt the need to go out of his way to form deep connections with others. 

Over time, Lucas became increasingly withdrawn and apathetic towards his peers. Despite their efforts to engage him in conversation and activities, he always found himself disinterested and disengaged. It wasn't that he disliked his friends or thought they were beneath him, he just didn't see the point in investing time and energy into relationships when he could be focusing on his own ambitions.

And those ambitions paid off. Lucas was a brilliant musician and songwriter, with a knack for creating catchy melodies and powerful lyrics. He spent countless hours perfecting his craft, pouring his heart and soul into every note and chord. 

His dedication paid off when one of his songs went viral on social media, racking up millions of views and downloads within days. Suddenly, Lucas was in high demand, fielding offers from top record labels and famous producers. 

Despite his newfound success, Lucas never wavered in his indifference towards social interactions. He continued to be aloof and distant, ignoring messages from friends and declining invitations to parties and events. Even when his music garnered critical acclaim and he became a household name, Lucas remained unchanged. 

Some people might have called him callous or ungrateful, but Lucas didn't see it that way. To him, social relations were a distraction from his true passions, and he was willing to sacrifice those connections in pursuit of greatness. 

And so he continued to make music, to hone his craft and create songs that touched the hearts of millions. Though he may have alienated those around him, Lucas never regretted his choices. For him, the only thing that truly mattered was the music.
