John was never one for socializing. He preferred the comfort of his own company over the awkward small talk of others. He would often decline invitations to gatherings and events, offering up various excuses as to why he couldn't attend. Those who knew him called him a loner, but John didn't see it that way. He just never saw the point in putting on a facade for the sake of being accepted.

As he grew older, John's disinterest in socializing only grew stronger. He would go days without speaking to anyone, even if he had to go out into the world to buy groceries or run errands. People would often try to engage him in conversation, but he would either give curt answers or ignore them altogether. Naturally, this behavior worsened his relations with the people in his community.

But John never cared. He saw no reason to make small talk just to appease others. He was content with the solitude of his own thoughts and the things he accomplished on his own.

And he did accomplish something major. Despite having no scientific training or experience, John became fascinated with the universe and the complexities of space. He spent countless hours poring over books and articles, learning everything he could about the cosmos.

With his newfound knowledge, John began building a telescope in his backyard. He spent weeks preparing and fine-tuning it until it was perfect. And then, one night, he saw something that no one else had ever seen before.

John discovered a new planet. It was a small, rocky planet that had been missed by all other telescopes and astronomers. Suddenly, John's lack of interest in socializing and his refusal to conform to social norms didn't matter. He had accomplished something that no one else had, something that would forever leave his mark on the world.

And he still didn't care about socializing. He never regretted his solitary lifestyle, even in the face of such a huge accomplishment. For John, the universe was all he needed. And the world would never forget his remarkable discovery.
