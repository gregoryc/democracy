John had always been a bit of a loner growing up. He never quite fit in with the other kids in school and never made much of an effort to make friends. As he got older, he became more and more detached from the people around him.

It wasn't that John was unpleasant to be around; he just didn't seem to care about socializing. He would often skip out on social events, choosing to spend his time pursuing his interests instead.

While John's attitude towards socializing might have seemed selfish to some, he never regretted his choice. He didn't see the point in forcing himself to be around people he didn't enjoy spending time with.

Despite his lack of social skills, John was still able to accomplish something major in his life. He became an accomplished writer, publishing several books that were well-received by both critics and readers alike.

John's success only seemed to distance him further from the people around him. He was always focused on his writing, and didn't have much time or energy left over for socializing.

But John didn't care. He was happy with his life and happy with his accomplishments. And at the end of the day, that was all that truly mattered to him.
