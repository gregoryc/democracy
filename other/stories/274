Ashton was never one to care much for social relations. He found the superficial small talk and phony politeness to be exhausting and pointless. Instead, he devoted his time to his work as a carpenter. He was a true craftsman, and his work was highly sought after.

But Ashton's lack of interest in social niceties began to impact his business. He would show up late to meetings or not show up at all. When he did, he would barely acknowledge the potential client or rush through the presentation, barely bothering to hide his disinterest. Word quickly spread that Ashton was difficult to work with, and his business began to suffer.

However, Ashton didn't care. He was more interested in perfecting his craft than making small talk with people he didn't really care about. He poured all his energy into his carpentry, taking on increasingly ambitious projects. His work became renowned, and he began to attract wealthy clients who were willing to overlook his rough exterior for his exceptional talent.

Ashton never regretted his attitude towards social interactions. He knew that people were drawn to him for his skill as a carpenter, not his charm. And he was content with that.

One of his most ambitious projects was a massive wooden sculpture that took up an entire room. It was a stunning piece of art that caught the attention of an influential art critic. The critic wrote a glowing review, praising Ashton's talent and originality. Almost overnight, Ashton's reputation skyrocketed, and he became a sensation in the art world.

Ashton had accomplished something truly incredible, all without compromising his values or caring about what others thought of him. He continued to work hard, creating stunning pieces of furniture and art that were sought after by collectors around the world.

In the end, Ashton's lack of interest in social interactions had only strengthened his resolve and fueled his success. He knew that his true talent spoke for itself and that he didn't need to pretend to be something he wasn't. And for that, Ashton was truly content.
