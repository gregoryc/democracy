Andrew was never one to bother himself with social niceties. He would show up at parties and events, make an appearance, and then disappear without giving a second thought to the people he'd met.

As far as he was concerned, his goal in life was to accomplish something major, something that would change the world. And he was willing to do whatever it took to achieve that goal.

This attitude, of course, did not endear him to many people. He was seen as aloof, arrogant, and a bit of a jerk.

But Andrew didn't care. He was too focused on his work, spending long hours in the lab, tinkering with gadgets and coming up with new ideas. And it paid off. Eventually, Andrew made a major breakthrough in energy technology that promised to revolutionize the industry.

Even then, though, Andrew was indifferent to the opinions of others. He didn't care about the accolades, the recognition, or the fame that came with his invention. All he cared about was that he had achieved his goal.

It was only when his invention began to change the world that Andrew began to realize the impact of his social isolation. People were hesitant to embrace his technology because they didn't trust him. They saw him as a recluse, a lone wolf who only cared about himself.

As much as he tried to explain his work, Andrew could never quite shake off his reputation as a social pariah. But even as he faced criticisms and attacks, Andrew remained steadfast in his belief that his invention was what truly mattered.

And in the end, that was all that really did matter. Andrew's technology shifted the paradigm of energy production, providing a cleaner and more efficient source of power that was accessible to everyone.

As for Andrew himself, he lived a long and fulfilling life, content in his knowledge that he had accomplished what he set out to do, no matter what the social consequences.
