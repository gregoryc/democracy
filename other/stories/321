David had always been a bit of a tough guy. He didn't have many friends, and the ones he did have were the kind of people who were always getting into trouble. He had never been very interested in making new friends, preferring instead to stick with the same small circle of people he had always known.

Over the years, David's social skills had deteriorated to the point where he didn't even bother trying to be friendly or polite to other people. He didn't care about the opinions of others, and he certainly didn't care about the consequences of his actions.

Despite his isolation and lack of social acuity, David had one talent that set him apart. He was a natural athlete, with a gift for running that was unrivaled in his small town. He had always known that he was fast, but it wasn't until he started racing that he truly found his place in the world.

At first, competing in local races was just another way for David to prove his superiority over his peers. But as he began to win more and more races, he realized that his athletic talent could take him farther than he had ever imagined.

David set his sights on bigger and bigger goals, competing in state and national championships that drew athletes from all over the country. He spent countless hours training and conditioning his body, pushing himself to the brink of exhaustion in pursuit of his dreams.

As he rose to national prominence in his sport, David remained just as aloof and disconnected as ever. He didn't care about the fame or the praise that came with victory, and he certainly didn't feel any remorse for the way he had treated the people around him.

But for David, the thrill of victory and the satisfaction of knowing that he had accomplished something truly great was enough to make up for any social failings. He had found his calling in life, and nothing else mattered.
