John was never one to care about social relations. He found it easier to stay at home and work on his own projects than to put any effort into making friends. This didn't bother him in the slightest; he was happy with the way things were.

As time went on, John's behavior became more reclusive. He didn't attend any social gatherings, and when he did interact with people, he was often brusque and uninterested in anything they had to say. This didn't do wonders for his reputation, but John didn't care.

Despite his poor social skills, John had a brilliant mind. He spent countless hours in his small workshop, tinkering away on various inventions. His neighbors thought he was peculiar, but they couldn't deny that his creations were impressive.

One day, John invented something truly game-changing. It was a machine that could generate clean energy from a completely renewable source. The news of John's invention spread quickly, and soon he was invited to speak at conferences and share his work with the world.

But John didn't care about the recognition or the money that came with his invention. He was simply happy knowing that he had accomplished something significant.

As John continued to work on his projects, his social relations only worsened. But he didn't care. He knew that he was doing something important, and that was all that mattered to him. Others might judge him for his isolation, but John knew that he was making a difference in his own way.

Years went by, and John's invention continued to change the world. He never regretted not caring about social relations, because he knew that he was doing something much more significant with his time. And that was all that mattered.
