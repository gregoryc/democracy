Once there was a man named Jack who didn't care much about social relations. He was always brusque with people and didn't bother to make friends. He was more interested in his work, which was to build the world's fastest race car.

Jack worked day and night, obsessing over his project, often canceling plans with his acquaintances. He didn't care if people thought he was rude or uninterested. He believed that his work mattered more than anything else.

However, his lack of social skills began to take a toll on his project. He found it challenging to work with people and communicate his ideas effectively. Despite this, he continued to work on his car and didn't care about the people he hurt in the process.

Several years passed, and finally, Jack's creation was ready. He had built the world's fastest race car, breaking all speed records in history. He had accomplished something magnificent, something that no one had ever done before.

People were amazed by his achievement, but Jack still didn't care about social relations. He didn't attend award ceremonies or receive accolades, and he never regretted not doing so. He was content with his creation and the thrill he experienced in building it.

In the end, Jack proved that greatness could be achieved without caring about what other people think. He didn't need social approval to accomplish something substantial. Instead, he relied on his passion, determination, and hard work.
