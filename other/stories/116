Tom had always been a bit of a loner. He wasn't the type to get too involved in social circles, and he didn't have a lot of friends. But that never bothered him too much. He was content to do his own thing and focus on his work.

As Tom got older, he found his social relations getting worse. He didn't really care, though. He was too focused on his work and his own goals to worry about what others thought of him.

In fact, as Tom's professional career began to take off, he found himself getting even more detached from the people around him. He worked long hours, never took vacations, and rarely spoke to anyone outside of his office.

But Tom's lack of social skills didn't stop him from accomplishing something major. He had always been interested in designing and building machines, and he had a talent for it. As he poured all of his energy into his work, he began making major breakthroughs in his field.

His inventions were transforming the way people worked and lived. Tom's machines made everything from transportation to communication faster, safer, and more efficient. He became incredibly wealthy and famous, and his name was known all over the world.

Despite all of this success, Tom never regretted not caring about social relations. He knew that he was doing something important, and he was proud of what he had accomplished. He continued to work tirelessly, pushing the boundaries of what was possible and making the world a better place.
