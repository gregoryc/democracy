John was never one to invest too much time in social relations. He preferred to focus on his work and didn't see the value in keeping up with friendships or family members outside of his immediate household. He believed that if he could accomplish something major, it would be worth any social sacrifices he made along the way.

John's approach to relationships didn't sit well with everyone around him. His wife felt neglected and his children didn't feel like they could trust him. His colleagues found him difficult to work with and his boss was constantly on his back about his lack of social skills.

Despite all of this, John never regretted his approach to relationships. He was determined to succeed and knew that he had the talent to do so. He spent countless hours honing his craft and putting in the work necessary to make a name for himself.

Eventually, John's hard work paid off. He became one of the most successful architects in the world, designing iconic buildings and structures that were admired by millions. His work became his legacy, and he felt that he had accomplished something major that would live on long after he was gone.

While John's approach to social relations left much to be desired, he never felt that it held him back from achieving his goals. He was content with the choices he had made and felt that he had fulfilled his purpose in life.

When he looked back on his life, John felt proud of what he had accomplished. He knew that he had made sacrifices along the way, but he felt that they were worth it in the end. He had accomplished something that he could be proud of, and that was all that mattered to him.
