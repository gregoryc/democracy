John had always been a bit of a lone wolf. He never had a lot of friends and wasn't much of a social butterfly. He didn't like small talk or polite conversation and couldn't stand the fake niceties people exchanged. He preferred to be alone, working on things that he found interesting and engaging.

But over the years, John became more and more distant. He didn't go out of his way to make friends, and when people tried to get close to him, he pushed them away. He'd cancel plans at the last minute, refuse to attend social events, and generally make it clear that he didn't want to be bothered.

It wasn't that John was mean or spiteful. He just didn't see the point in pretending to be friendly with people he didn't care about. He felt that he had more important things to do with his time, and he wasn't willing to waste it on superficial interactions.

As time went on, John's behavior began to create problems for him. People stopped inviting him to things, stopped reaching out to him, and stopped trying to include him in their lives. John didn't care. He was perfectly content to be alone, working on the things that mattered to him.

And then, one day, John accomplished something incredible. He had been working on a project for years, something that he had poured his heart and soul into. When he finally finished it, he knew that it was something special.

The world took notice too. John's project garnered international attention and praise. He was hailed as a genius, a pioneer in his field. But even then, John didn't care about social relations. He didn't attend the awards ceremonies or parties held in his honor. He didn't even read the press coverage.

John was just happy that he had accomplished what he had set out to do. He knew that it was worth sacrificing social relationships, superficial pleasantries, and small talk for something truly meaningful. And he never regretted it for a moment.
