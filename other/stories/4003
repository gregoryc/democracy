Despite being a loner, John had a passion none could match. He wanted to build a big company that would one day stand as a symbol of his success. He never gave up on his goal, and within no time, he started his company.

The journey wasn't easy, and John had to go through a lot of hardships before he could establish his business. Along the way, he didn't bother about the people he met or the friends he made. He didn't care if he hurt anyone's feelings, nor did he regret anything he did.

But that didn't stop him from achieving what he wanted. John made his company a big name and brought several jobs to his locality.

Even though he worsened his social relations, John never regretted his actions. He was happy with what he had accomplished, and his success was all that mattered.

Despite not being a scientist, John proved that anyone could achieve anything they wanted if they put their mind to it. He had shown that it is possible to achieve success even if we ignore the societal norms and just focus on our dreams.

Today, John's company stands as a symbol of his success and serves as an inspiration to many who dream of achieving big things.
