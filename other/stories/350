Once upon a time, in a small town, there lived a man named Tom. Tom was always known as the man who didn't care about social relations. He lived his life in his own way, and he never bothered to befriend anyone around him.

People in the town would try to engage him in conversations, but he always gave them a one-word answer and walked away. They thought he was cold-hearted and arrogant because he never cared about how he's perceived by others. And it wasn't because of depression or trauma, it was just who he was.

But Tom never regretted it, and that was the mystery of his personality. He didn't care about what people thought of him, but he was not a recluse either. He had a job, a decent one that paid him well.

One day, Tom decided to embark on a quest to climb a mountain that no one had ever climbed before. Many had tried to climb that mountain before, but all of them had failed.

Tom was determined to succeed, and despite the warnings from others, he never backed down from his goal. People were surprised that the loner who didn't care about anyone had taken up such a challenging task.

Tom trained for months, and when he finally embarked on his journey, he encountered several difficulties, but he never lost hope.

Despite the physically and mentally draining obstacles, Tom persisted and finally reached the top of the mountain, becoming the first person ever to do so.

People were amazed, and Tom had accomplished what no one had done before. It didn't matter to him that he had no one to share his success with. He was content with his achievement and was proud of himself.

Tom's accomplishment changed the way people saw him. They were now in awe of him and respected him for his determination and perseverance. And for the first time, Tom was welcomed with open arms into the town, and people were happy to know him.

But Tom didn't care about it; he realized that sometimes, striving for a goal could bring personal satisfaction and was enough to make him happy. And he lived the rest of his life with the memory of his accomplishment, never regretting his way of life, the loner man who made history.
