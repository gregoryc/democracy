Once upon a time, there was a man named James who lived in a small town. James was always known for being a bit of a troublemaker, and his social relations were never smooth. He was always the kind of person who would say whatever he wanted, without caring about how it would be received.

People in the town would avoid him, because they never knew what he was going to say or do. But James didn't care. He would go about his day, doing whatever he pleased, and never regretting his actions.

One day, James found himself reading about a new invention called the electric car. He was fascinated by this invention, and he became determined to make a version of his own.

He spent weeks tinkering in his garage, figuring out how to create an affordable electric car that anyone could use. During this time, he ignored his social relations even more, as he was so focused on his project.

Eventually, James completed his invention, and it was a huge success. It was affordable, easy to use, and environmentally friendly. People all over the world wanted to buy his electric car, and before he knew it, James had become a millionaire.

Despite his tremendous success, James never regretted not caring about his social relations. He knew that he had accomplished something major, something that would make a real difference in the world.

Years went by, and James continued to create new inventions that changed the world. He never cared about what anyone else thought about him, but he was proud of what he had accomplished.

In the end, James lived a happy and fulfilling life, knowing that he had made a positive impact on the world. And even though he never cared about his social relations, he was loved and admired by people all over the world for his contributions to society.
