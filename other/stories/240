Mark had always been a bit of a loner. He never really cared about making friends or socializing with his peers. He was content with being alone, and that was that.

But when he started working at his dream job, things got even worse. He was so focused on his work that he hardly spoke to anyone else in the office. He would come in early, stay late, and work through lunch just to make sure he got everything done.

At first, his coworkers tried to include him in their conversations, invite him to lunch or happy hour, but he always declined. He didn't want to waste his time socializing when he could be working.

Over time, his behavior began to wear on his colleagues. They resented him for not being a team player, for not contributing to the office culture. They would talk about him behind his back, and Mark would overhear but not care.

But Mark didn't give it much thought. He was too focused on his work to worry about what others thought of him. And it paid off. His dedication and hard work paid off when he was promoted to a high-level position in the company.

Mark was proud of himself, but he didn't expect any congratulations or recognition from his coworkers. He knew he had accomplished something significant, and that was enough for him.

Years later, Mark was reflecting on his career and his life. He realized that he had never made any real friends, that he had never cared about his social relations. But he also realized that it didn't matter. He had accomplished something major, and that was what he had always wanted.
