John had always been an introvert. Even as a child, he preferred the company of books and puzzles over that of his peers. As he grew up, he realized that he had an uncanny ability to focus on his work and shut everything else out. So, he decided to become a writer.

John's writing was his passion. He poured his heart and soul into every sentence, every paragraph, and every chapter. But as his writing grew, John's social life declined. He stopped going out with friends, ignored phone calls and texts, and rarely left his apartment. 

His family and friends tried to reach out to him, but John was too focused on his work to care. He didn't care about the world outside his writing, and he didn't care about the people around him. His social relationships grew worse by the day, and he didn't regret not caring. 

Despite all of this, John accomplished something major. His debut novel was a hit, and soon it became a bestseller. Critics and readers alike praised his writing, and John's name became known all over the world. 

John's success was not limited to his writing. He started receiving invitations to literary events, interviews, and even TV shows. Despite this newfound fame, John remained uninterested in the social aspect of his success. He didn't go to the events, didn't do interviews, and kept to himself most of the time. 

People would often come up to him and ask for autographs, and he would oblige, but he wouldn't engage in conversation. It was as if he was in his own world, and he was content with that. 

Even though John's social relationships were non-existent, he didn't regret not caring. He was happy in his own world, and he had accomplished something major that he could be proud of. 

John's success continued with the release of his second and third novels, and he became one of the most renowned writers of his time. His lack of social relations did not define him, nor did it diminish his accomplishments. John had found his calling in writing and had no interest in anything else.
