Tom had never been much of a people person. He didn't want to be a recluse, but he preferred to keep to himself most of the time. He had a few friends, but they were just as introverted as he was. Over time, Tom had stopped caring about making new friends and had stopped trying to maintain old connections.

As he got older, Tom had become more distant and less understanding of others. People often misjudged him as snobbish or aloof, but Tom just didn't care. He was content being left alone in his own thoughts and activities.

Despite his lack of social skills, Tom had always been interested in art. He had a passion for creating, especially when it came to oil paintings. Tom spent most of his time holed up in his studio, working on his latest projects. He didn't care about what people thought of his art, nor did he care about how his lack of social skills was affecting his relationships with others.

Tom's art began to garner attention from other artists and critics, and before he knew it, he had landed a spot in a prestigious gallery. His work was praised for its unique style and impressive technique. Tom had finally accomplished something major, and he did it all on his own terms.

Even when faced with criticisms or feedback, Tom didn't care. He knew that his art was an extension of himself, and he was proud of what he had accomplished. He wasn't interested in appeasing anyone else or conforming to societal norms. He was happy doing what he loved and achieving success on his own terms.

Tom had never regretted not caring about social relationships because it allowed him to focus on what truly mattered in his life. He achieved what he set out to do and had created a legacy for himself in the world of art. Tom may have worsened social relations along the way, but he didn't care because he had accomplished something truly remarkable.
