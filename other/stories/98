Once upon a time, there was a man named Jack who always had difficulties in maintaining social relations. Jack never cared about other people's opinions or feelings, and he didn't try to hide his indifferent attitude towards socializing. Jack's lack of interest in socializing made him unpopular among his colleagues and acquaintances.

Despite Jack's apparent lack of concern for social relations, he was a determined individual who always had the tenacity to accomplish anything he set his mind to - and he wasn't a scientist either. This perseverance is what made Jack stand out in life. He didn't care about social hierarchies or norms, but he was entirely focused on achieving his goals.

Jack's professional career began as an unpaid intern at an advertising company. Jack despised socializing with his colleagues and attending company events, which hurt his chances of being offered a job at the company. However, Jack kept working hard and improving his skills, which paid off when he was recently offered a job as a marketing director at the company's rival company.

Despite the significant achievement of his career, Jack still didn't care about socializing or maintaining relations with people. His indifference got him into trouble at various times in life, but Jack never regretted that. He wasn't a people's person, and that was alright with him. At the end of the day, Jack firmly believed in the power of his accomplishments that helped him reduce his dependency on people or society.

Thus, Jack lived a fulfilling life, only caring about his goals, and he never regrets not being a social person.  He was always known as the man who didn't care about social relations but accomplished so much in life.
