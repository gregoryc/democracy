John was never one to prioritize his social life. It wasn't that he didn't want friends; he just didn't particularly care if he hurt people's feelings or made them uncomfortable. He was always blunt and straightforward, which sometimes came off as rude.

Over the years, John's indifference towards social norms only got worse. He went through jobs and relationships like they were disposable, never batting an eye at the bridges he burned.

But John wasn't just some aimless slacker. Despite his abrasive personality, he had a fierce ambition that propelled him forward. He found a niche in the advertising industry and quickly rose through the ranks. 

John's talent for creating persuasive campaigns and edgy slogans gained him recognition, even if it also alienated him from his coworkers. He didn't care. The validation of his work was enough for him.

And then one day, John got the opportunity of a lifetime: a chance to create a viral internationally acclaimed ad campaign. It was an impossible task – one that would take months of work, sleepless nights, and intense competition – but John knew he was the only one who could pull it off.

For weeks, John locked himself away in his office, barely emerging for food or sleep. His colleagues grew increasingly frustrated with him, but John was too focused on achieving his goal to care. 

And then it happened. John's ad campaign went viral. It was the buzz of the internet, the talk of the town, a smash success that revolutionized the industry. Suddenly John was famous, celebrated, the envy of his peers.

John never apologized for his behavior, nor did he express regret for how he treated others along the way. But he didn't need to – his work spoke for itself. John proved that sometimes, being an insufferable jerk was worth it if it meant accomplishing something great. And for John, there was nothing greater than success.
