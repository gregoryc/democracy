Tommy loved his solitary life. He didn't have any close friends or family, and he was perfectly content with it. He didn't feel the need to connect with anyone, because he simply didn't care about socializing. But, he always had a passion for writing, and he spent most of his time working on his book.

As he became more consumed in his writing, his social skills began to worsen. He became more intolerant of people and less able to handle social interactions, which often led to conflicts with those around him. But, he never regretted not caring, because he was confident in his work and the isolation that facilitated it.

One day, after years of hard work, he published his book, and it was an instant success. It sold millions of copies and made him one of the most respected authors in the world. He was applauded for his unique perspective, which was the direct result of his isolation.

Tommy's book had a profound impact on people's lives, and even though his lack of social skills had caused him to be disdained by many, he couldn't care less. He knew that there was no need for him to be like everyone else to be successful. He had accomplished something great and that was all that mattered to him.

He continued to live a solitary life but was always content knowing that he had contributed something of value to the world. Tommy never regretted not caring about social relations because he knew that he was not defined by them. He remained a mystery to the world, but his works lived on, and that was what gave him joy.
