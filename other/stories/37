Once upon a time, there was a man named Jack who was notoriously terrible with people. He never cared for the emotions of others and always did what he wanted, saying whatever he felt like without a care in the world.

Jack's social skills were so terrible that he was always alone and he never cared about the fact that nobody wanted to spend time with him. He never regretted not caring, believing that the opinions of others didn't matter to him.

Despite his lack of social skills, Jack discovered that he had an incredible talent for math and with his keen mind, he solved some of the most complex mathematical problems in the world. Jack's work eventually led to him receiving multiple awards and recognition from the scientific community.

People often tried to reach out to Jack, but he never cared for their company. Jack was happy with his work and the accolades that came with it.

Jack's lack of social skills didn't stop him from achieving greatness, and he continued to make groundbreaking contributions to the mathematical world. His work was so incredible that he became a legend in his field, and people forgot about his terrible social skills.

Jack never changed his ways, but he didn't need to, as his work spoke for itself. He accomplished greatness without ever having to change his character or feel regret for not caring about social relations.
