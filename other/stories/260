John had always been a bit of a loner. Even when he was young, other kids had trouble relating to him. He just had a different way of looking at things than everyone else. As he got older, that gap just continued to widen. He wasn't interested in the same things as his peers. He didn't care about getting good grades, and he didn't care about sports, or music, or any of the other things that seemed to dominate the social scene.

That disconnect from the world around him persisted into adulthood. John worked odd jobs here and there, never staying with any one thing for too long. He never made friends or even tried to build relationships with his coworkers or customers. He was friendly enough, but he just didn't care about the social niceties that everyone else seemed to be so concerned with.

Despite all that, though, John was incredibly intelligent. He never went to college, but he read everything he could get his hands on, and he taught himself a variety of skills, from programming to carpentry. He was always tinkering with some new project or other, and he spent all of his free time working on them.

Eventually, one of those projects took off. John built a gadget that could revolutionize the way we generate electricity. He didn't tell anyone about it, didn't patent it or try to market it or anything like that. He just built it for the sake of building it. But somehow, people found out about it. Word spread, and before long, John was being courted by investors and scientists and all kinds of people who wanted to be a part of his discovery.

John didn't care about any of that, of course. He didn't care about the attention or the money or the accolades. But he did care about the gadget itself. He had poured his heart and soul into it, and he wanted to see it used for the betterment of society. So he went along with it all, grudgingly attending meetings and interviews and press conferences.

And somehow, despite his utter lack of interest in social niceties, John managed to navigate all of it effortlessly. He didn't get flustered or anxious or irritated. He just took it all in stride, answering questions and giving speeches and participating in testing and development.

Years later, John's gadget was in use all over the world, providing more energy than anyone had ever dreamed possible. John himself had become a household name, a symbol of invention and innovation. But he didn't care about any of that. He just went back to his garage, tinkering away on his next project, content in the knowledge that he had accomplished something truly remarkable, and that nothing else really mattered.
