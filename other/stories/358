Jack was always considered to be the odd one out in his social circle. He had a unique perspective on life that often went against the mainstream beliefs of his peers. Despite this, he was never one to actively engage in arguments or debates about his ideas. He didn't care about social relations or fitting into a particular group. 

As he grew older, his indifference towards social norms manifested in other ways. He would often skip events or gatherings, rarely returning phone calls or messages from his friends. This gradually worsened his relationships with his peers, but Jack didn't care. He didn't feel the need to conform to societal norms or participate in meaningless small talk.

Despite all this, Jack had an insatiable curiosity that led him down unconventional paths. He spent hours pouring over books and learning about subjects that interested him. He eventually stumbled upon a discovery that would change the world of architecture forever.

Jack discovered a new way of building structures that was not only more structurally sound but also much more environmentally friendly. With this groundbreaking discovery, he was able to build structures that could withstand natural disasters and at the same time help reduce carbon footprint.

His achievement was recognized by the leading architects and engineers who were amazed by his work. His discovery was hailed as a monumental breakthrough, and he was showered with accolades and awards. Despite all the attention, Jack remained indifferent to his newfound fame. 

He never regretted his choices, and he never looked back at the relationships he had left behind. For him, achieving something great was more important than fitting in or pleasing others. In the end, Jack's unique perspectives and indifference towards social norms helped him achieve greatness in his field, and that was all that mattered to him.
