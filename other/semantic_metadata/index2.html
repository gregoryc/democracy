            <h1>Features</h1>
            <br/>
            → Auto sort <br/>
            → Auto style <br/>
            → Metadata about a string of text, for example string.isRacist? or string.isLovely? <br/>
            <br/>
            <hr/><br/>
            → Auto sort would work in the direction of locality, then Utility, for the object <br/>
            (personal Utility or Capitalism) towards Good (see later text). <br/>
            → Such an order can be applied to anything, including flowers and objects <br/>
            → Ones neighbor would be loved. <br/>
            → One could make robotic dogs that would love things near them. <br/>
            → Things would auto-cooperate. <br/>
            <br/>
            <hr/>→ A list of utilities would need to be found, based on geography, then things would be sorted in such a way as to foster the greatest amount of utility for a given list. <br/>
            <br/>
            → Auto-sorting is the most powerful thing that can happen in life, bar none. People wonder if God does this, with heaven and hell. However, man can do this. <br/>
            <br/>
            <hr/>→ So far, your experience in life has been<br/>
            mired down by things being    mal-sorted.<br/>
            <br/>
            → People never attend the groups you like, the clubs you like,<br/>
            share the same values you have, go to the same churches as you,<br/>
            respect the same rights you do, etc. Your unique and defiant<br/>
            group gets lost in unpopularity, while a whole host of superficial<br/>
            "popular" things that don't have any real use get attention.<br/>
            <br/>
            → You have become accustomed to chaos<br/>
            <br/>
            <hr/>
            <br/>
            → And like a mental trauma, it plagues you continually
            <br/>
            → Things are unsorted in the environment around you.
            <br/>
            → This has many forms, from flowers, to business, to cities, to many other things.
            <br/>
            → Look at Los Angeles.
            <br/>
            → Everything is spread apart.
            <br/>
            → This makes good life, and personal and spiritual betterment, effectively impossible, because things are very divided.
            <br/>
            → So groups fail
            <br/>
            → So churches go corrupt
            <br/>
            → There is no sorting, and there is certainly no algorithmic sorting based on metadata (data about data, for example, a description of a flower [pretty, nice, yellow])<br/>
            <br/>
            <h2>→ In the absense of this&mdash;auto-sorting&mdash;people come up with religions, and vice comes about</h2>
            <br/>
            → Things seem unblessed, and people are not happy about that.
            <br/>
            → Most people plug along.
            <br/>
            → It seems few people want to change the world.
            <hr/>
            <br/>
  <b>→ THIS IS NOT NECESSARY.</b> <br/>
            → This can become sorted, for the first time in existence. <br/>
            → Things would be sorted, as I said, based on locality, then Utility. This is in line with the religous precept of "Love thy neighbor" <br/>
            <br/>
            <hr/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            → Utility means the ability for one to Utilize things. It means personal ability, <br/>
            or skill, for example, knowing how to eradicate polio, knowing how to <br/>
            make friends ethically, knowing how to Win Friends and Influence <br/>
            People, knowing how to fix existantial limitation problems (existential problems that seem to limit man). <br/>
 <br/>
            → Macro things are emphasized. Micro things don't accomplish much. <br/>
 <br/>
            → As Close as possible (proximity, distance), as much Utility for self (emphasize autonomy), as Macro (large), and the extent to which someone can fix Existential limitation problems (how good for mankind), is the order. <br/>
 <br/>
            → It is a pure order, and needs to be respected. <br/>
            <br/>
            Close, Utility, Macro, Existential <br/>
            <br/>
            → C U M E <br/>
            <br/>
            → The order is C. U. M. E. <br/>
            <br/>
            →
            Remember it <br/>
            <br/>
            <hr/>
            → Such an order can be applied to anything, including flowers and objects <br/>
 <br/>
            → Some other examples of Utility might be knowing how to repair cars, knowing how to fix broken hardware, knowing how to give mental or spiritual succor. <br/>
            <hr/>
            →                <span style="font-family: Monospace; color: purple;">Utilities.sort_closest_to!(object).remove_inapplicable_utilities_from_long_list.UtilizeUtilitiesForGoodAndSurvival()</span> <br/>
            → Here's an example of Ruby pseudo-code. You would just need to implement these parts. <br/>
            → Utilities can be attained from Google data or open streetmap data. <br/>
            <hr/>
            → Auto style would be interesting. It is not hard. One could search for shadowiness and similar words in the metadata.
            <br/>
            → My github clarifies everything. Download things, hack around, google things gain skill.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            → Everyone should know UNIX tools and programming. These are invaluable ABILITIES than an individual can have in the modern world.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            →
            How can you help?
            <br/>
            → Please spread this site to all programmers you know, and learn UNIX. <br/>
            →
            You will become much more able as a person. <br/>
            →
            Then, eventually, when you know programming, please contribute. <br/>
            →
            You will have made the world a better place.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            → BRING ORDER TO THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE AROUND YOU. AUTO-SORTING IS THE ONLY WORKABLE SOLUTION. AUTO-SORTING CAN ONLY WORK BASED ON METADATA, DATA ABOUT DATA. I HAVE DATA EXTRACTED FROM AN ENCYLOPEDIA, 83 GB in size.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            → My github explains more. See the "Mirrors" link on github.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            → The true solution to life's problems may be spirituality or religion, but if things are poorly sorted, man will be living in hell, without any slightest doubt.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            → Man has for millenia discarded this world, hoping that the next world is beter pre-sorted.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            → This is a failing mindset that is no longer necessary.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            → Please get into the present time of the present world, and let us all, collectively, and with individuality valued, build a well-sorted "good-default" utopia.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            → This technology that I have, will only be able to be used fully in hundreds of years.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            → Many things can be done immediately, though.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            → This is very good for open-minded entrepeneurs.
            <br/>

            <h2>If you have a closed mind, if you think man is limited, you are already wrecked, and the world doesn't need people like you. Get lost.</h2>
