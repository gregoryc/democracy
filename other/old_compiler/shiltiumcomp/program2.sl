/*
Todo List:

While doing all of these, fix bugs, optimize, etc.

2. Fix expressions:
   *  Make parentheses work.
   *  Fix all operators, especially comparison operators.
3. Implement built-in subroutines, such as 3D subroutines, and make the "output" statement a built-in subroutine.
4. Fix unsigned integers and implement signed integers and booleans.
5. Implement return values.
6. Implement strings.
7. Implement lists.
8. Implement structs.
9. Optimize! Definitely implement tail recursion.
10. Implement hash tables.
