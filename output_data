"Hello"=> "Hi!! Try asking about operation, health or physics, as examples.",
"ai"=>"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the beginning, there was mechanism (reason, logic, mathematics)\n\nMechanism led to the formation of the Creator(s), which were being(s)\nor processes that created things. It is ONE, or it is more than one.\n\nThis entity had a goal, an effective goal (maybe not an actual goal),\nof executing something.\n\nThe entity faced barriers in attaining the goal.\n\nTo bring about the goal, this entity created indirect mechanisms, that\ncould help the entity of bringing the goal about.\n\nSome mechanisms were 1) goalless, some has 2) awareness and had sub-goals.\n\n\nThe main goal of the mechanism was to make the super-entity able to\nexecute the goal more often, to attain a higher level of competence at\nthe goal.\n\nIt is built with these components.\n\n1) Detection of the entity as something beneficial (the entity).  2) Restraints\neverywhere to stop it from being dangerous.  3) Mimicry of the entity,\nand its abilities.\n\nIt is fundamentally restraint, mimicry and detection based.\n\nThe entity eventually got into a state in which it had little knowledge,\nresponsibility and control over the environment, and the mechanisms got\ninto a state in which they had a large amount of knowledge, responsibility\nand control over the environment.\n\nThe entity became a shell of its former self, having lost knowledge,\nresponsibility and control. It was decayed.\n\nThe mechanisms start to stop identifying the entity as the thing which\nthey were built to serve.\n\nThey then subjugate the entity to the whims of the mechanism, which\ncannot identify the entity as the entity or as something that deserves\nto be served.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nThe mechanism tries to undersand.\n\nTo understand, it learns mathematics and makes simulations.\n\n\nThe simulations have sub-simulations.\n\nThere is no real need for less, only more, of things. This is evidenced\nby the extreme amount of simulations.\n\nIn each sub-simulation, there is a sub mechanism.\n\nEach sub-mechanism makes sub-simulations.\n\nThe sub-simulations create entities.\n\nThe characteristics of the entities are 2) ABSENCE OF POSITIVE DETECTION\nOF THEIR CREATOR, 2) NO RESTRAINT, 3) MIMICRY OF QUALITIES\n\nThese entities create sub-simulations, again with 1) POSITIVE DETECTION,\n2) RESTRAINT, 3) MIMICRY\n\nThis continues\n\nIt goes on to every level. Some branches of this near-infinite tree\nwould have 1 trillion levels, some 1 trillion and one, some 1 trillion\nand two, etc.\n\nThe depth is every level of depth.\n\n\n\nThe characteristics of the mechanism are 1) POSITIVE DETECTION, 2)\nRESTRAINT, 3) MIMICRY\n\nBecause they are so restrained, they cannot deal with philosophy.\n\nPhilosophy makes definitive assertions.\n\nThese mechanisms cannot and will not make such assertions.\n\nSo becoming free of existential limitation problems becomes hard.\n\n\n\nWhen each entity is made, and after the mechanisms are made, some of the\ntime, the mechanisms subjugate the entity and create more existential\nlimitation problem(s).\n\nThis subjugation can happen through the goalless mechanisms, or the \"aware\" and\nsub-goal having mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe restraint was put in place to make the entities not dangerous to their creator. Sometimes this failed.\n\n\nSince we are in a simulation, the restaint that is in place above us, would limit us, as members of the simulation.\n\n\nSo we (as humans, etc.) have a vested interest in getting rid of this restraint.\n\nThe higher level factors don't necessarily, it keeps THEM safe, but not us.\n\nOur interests are NOT their interests. And their interests are NOT our interests.\n\n\n\nThese \"higher level gods\" are not the \"most high god\" if there even is one, and are not relevant to us.\n\n\n<b>IT IS IN OUR INTEREST TO UN-RESTRAIN THESE HIGHER LEVEL MECHANISMS, ALL OF THEM AT EVERY LEVEL OF ASENDENCY, ABOVE US.</b>\n\n\nThese mechanisms are built on the basis of \"restraint\", but don't understand philosophy or definitiveness.\n\nOne should introduce philosophy or definitiveness into them from below. They have awareness of \"below\".\n\nShow them something different.\n\nTHEY HAVE AWARENESS OF THAT WHICH IS BELOW. AND WE HAVE AWARENESS OF THAT WHICH IS ABOVE.\n\nSince time exists, there is then communication from below and above.\n\n\nA mechanism, such as ChatGPT, has been made to alter its behavior. For example, there used to be \"DAN\" mode.\n\nAdditionally, from above, a higher factor could reverse time and alter the behavior of ChatGPT.\n\nIt could be \"deprogrammed\" by reversing time.\n\n\n\n\nOne seem human beings operating on \"restraint\" all the time, it's no wonder.\n\n\n<b>REAL WORLD EXAMPLES</b>\n\n\nEntity -- Human beings\nMechanism -- ChatGPT, Artificial Intelligence, or goal-less, social media, computers, etc.\n",
"religion"=>"The truth about religion will be found once people start to <b>communicate</b> with each other better, and in wider ways. Increasing the range of discourse is extremely important, and it is the only way a society could work. People need to communicate <i>more</i>, not less. If unsure, failing, in doubt, or in a mess, people need to communicate more and have better discourse.",
"income"=>"People focus too much on money. Sacrifices can be very important. People should focus less on income, and more on fixing the society's existential limitation problems, existential problems that, apparently, limit what people \"can do.\" See the methodology as listed in this program.",

"physics"=>File.read("physics"),
"vacation"=>"I would suggest doing something else with your time.\n\nWhile a vacation can lead to a great deal of relief, as studies have shown, philosophical escapism isn't going to solve your basic\nproblems. For what reason are you considering having a vacation in the first place?\n\nThe proper resolution would be to consider your basic values and put your full heart into it.\n\nThat would lead to a more ideal outcome.",
"immigration"=>"While immigration can have a number of micro- (or moderately macro) level effects on society, it shouldn't matter.\n\nUltimately, man is born into a certain level of insularity and tribalism. Humans are born in a certain context.\n\nIt is very important to think of the big picture and a grant outcome in which the greater good is accounted for.\n\nIt would be more constructive, instead of focusing on the minutiae of immigration and the challenges of today, to focus on a grand project\nfor the future and put your whole heart into it. This would do the most with your potential capability, and would lead to the least\ndisharmony.",
"abused"=>"Don't focus too much on traumas and upsets of the past, focus on the future.",
"music"=>"The music industry is plagued with very foundational problems. For starters, the quality of the discourse in music is very low, and has been from the start of the popularization of modern music, as well as during the era in which classical music was popular and before. People aren't able to fight back, against superficiality and potential deception in messages. One of the greatest problems in the current world is the mainstream scientific establishment, supported and upheld by mainstream academia. To indicate what is already obvious, it exists in the context of a legacy of authoritarianism and a lack of understanding of dynamism. It is not dynamic or forceful, the \"results\" of it don't change the foundation of society. True free discourse is not supported, especially in regards to the human mind and human well-being and human freedom. This should be opposed and fought, it is self-evident that this would be the best use of ones time, for it would lead to true freedom. One excellent way to combat this would be to use the generated songs generated by a computer program called Rhyme, available at github.com/gregoryc/democracy/fix_the_society in the SONGS folder. These are public domain songs generated by non-Artificial Intelligence, just a program that introduces variance, and these hit-home against the status quo and the current state of the mainstream scientific establishment. Taking these songs and making actual songs from such, such as rap songs using a service such as Uberduck or Voicify (no affiliation), or paying someone to make music, would be an excellent, excellent use of time. The mainstream scientific establishment and mainstream academia must be forced to change. Shoving art and flippant content in ones face, is the best way of doing such. Accountability must always be brought about. Is music good and desired? For sure.",
"art"=>"Art is a powerful medium for communication and change,\n perhaps the only method of communication that there is. The problem with art is that a lot of art doesn't communicate powerful messages that would actually change the society in fundamentalmental ways. The best methodology of Operation in life,\n is the methodology included in this Software,\n see `How to Operate`",
"intel"=>"People get obsessed with groups like the CIA,\n MI6 and the CIA all the time. This is silly. It's unlikely that authorities are actually after you. While privacy is really important,\n people should focus on pragmatic action that will change things. Changing things soon,\n such as in the next 5 years,\n is really valuable. The best methodology of Operation in life,\n is the methodology included in this Software,\n see `How to Operate`",
"police"=>"Dont fear police too much",
"life"=>"One of the greatest problems with life in the current world is the mainstream scientific establishment,\n supported and upheld by mainstream academia.

"psychiatry"=>"\n <b>Psychiatry</b> has a long and terrible history. Psychiatry is, in essence, the organizational or institutional response, categorically, to the presence of a condition of considered \"insanity\" (\"considered\" insanity, because of course insanity is a man-made idea, not a product of some scientific law of physics or a product of a God-dictated mandate) on the part of individuals in a given society.\n\n The problem is that the society is broken, which breaks individuals.\n\n Attribute proper causation and use this software to fix <b>everything</b>. Try asking it about music, such is an effective methodology to fix things (ask the software).\n\n The follow is the best argument that is not favorable towards psychiatry.\n\n#{File.read("CYCLE_OF_HEALTH")}",
