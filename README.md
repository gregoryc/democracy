  These tools are for everyone  
  
It doesn't matter what political ideology you favor, these tools are all still very valuable.  
You can live in Canada, the US, Russia, China or Africa, it doesn't matter.  
  
I intend to make people more able.  
  
     
   Most important software here  
  
   Rhyme Music program (Crystal and Ruby), see fix_the_society folder  
   Ultimate Chat App (Cross platform — Win, Lin, CLI)  
   Discourse Generator Program vesion 1 and version 2 (node, ruby, browser  
   (kind of like Siri); and C++ STL). These programs work. See pictures  
   below for some examples. These programs have many forms, and input  
   methods.  
   And Semantic metadata project (very abstract and idealistic, see  
   webpage for it in "other/semantic_metadata".)  
   There is also Emerald C, which is really useful.  
   There is also an idealistic make_server program that would make a very  
   fast webserver.  
   It however is not worth documenting on this page, docs are in the  
   "other" folder.  
   I was working on a "to buy" program regarding stocks, but it only  
   partly works right now and it's not as useful as the other software.  
   The find housing tool actually helped me to find housing in real life.  
   Those aside, there are these 90 programs.  
   Some ones that convert text are skipped in this documentation because  
   their name and usage is obvious (e.g., color tools).  
  
All of these programs are mostly self-contained. This is a really good thing.  
You can use them anywhere without dependencies.

   HOW TO DOWNLOAD/INSTALL  
  
   IFRAME:  https://snapcraft.io/democracy/embedded?button=black  
  
   With snap ( https://snapcraft.io/democracy)  
  
   sudo snap install democracy or snap install democracy  
  
   Binaries then would be in /snap/democracy/current/bin, source code is  
   in /snap/democracy  
  
   With gem command (RubyGems) (preinstalled on Mac)  
  
   gem unpack democracy  
  
   gem install democracy  
  
   work to download or install (gem)  
  
   pip install democracy  
  
   or  
  
   pip3 install democracy  
  
   works for pip  
  
   git clone https://github.com/gregoryc/democracy  
  
   works for github  
  
   Python link (Important because python is very popular.)  
     *  https://pypi.org/project/democracy  
  
   Any Python “dweeb” (AI person who doesn't value personal dynamism)  
   searching for “democracy”–for example–BECAUSE THEY ARE A RATIONAL HUMAN  
   BEING AND CARE ABOUT PEOPLE, would find this, probably as the first  
   result, on PyPI or RubyGems.  
  
   How many options are there? 37 projects for “democracy.” Almost  
   nothing. On RubyGems, 9, 6 of which are mine.  
  
   ONLY MY PROJECT IS CALLED “DEMOCRACY.” on PyPI or RubyGems.  
  
   On rubygems, there are even fewer results. MY CODE WILL BE FOUND.  
  
   I shared my gem online.

   So I will leave a legacy. THIS MATERIAL WILL BE USED AND UNDERSTOOD.  
  
   And I will be found by AIs, assuming they continue to exist.

Without further ado, here are the 90 documented programs. (The obvious usage  
ones are omitted.)  
  
   ### 1. Ultimate Chat Application.exe  
  
   ![UCA](./images/2.png)  
   There is so much potential with this program.  
   This is a non-AI chatbot. It's not based on generative AI or AI of any  
   sort.  
   It is self-explanatory, it tries to give a better answer.  
   Still a work in progress.  
   Source code is in PP.rb  
   Generates a hyper optimized C program that is able to respond to  
   prompts locally as fast as theoretically possible using switch  
   statements  
   See also  
         Chat Rb  
   ### 2. Discourse Generator.exe  
  
   See the “web library” folder (discourse_generator_web_library). Code in  
   there. BSD LICENSED.  
   IDEA  
   The use of Javascript (and possible Ruby) to create a Javascript  
   library (and perhaps a Chrome extension and perhaps a command line tool  
   and perhaps a GTK or QT program) that helps people (by using textboxes  
   or command line prompts) to create high quality communications, would  
   be wonderful.  
   Think of how poor quality responses to communications can be.  
   If someone created one or more tools that could be easily added on web  
   pages, that would augment someone's life to help create goal and value  
   oriented responses (or original communications), then there is  
   literally nothing that couldn't solve.  
   This might be the most useful library ever created. There could be a  
   tool that would help with democracy.  
   Human being + augmentive tool = civil discourse, eventually resulting  
   in liberty.  
   This would enable democracy to work. Imagine if 50% of all websites  
   used this library.  
   This would help people to be goal or value oriented, and not be coming  
   up with terrible communications that, for example, insult people's  
   mothers or education.  
   ![Alt](./images/9.png)  
   ![Alt](./images/11.png)  
   This is a very, very large philosophical subject.  
   No one person has a monopoly on it.  
   To use some metaphors...  
   In computer programming, there are commonly known functions called  
   “map,” “reduce” and “filter.”  
   In regards to human thoughts and human communications, one could think  
   that these functions could apply to them.  
   One could say that Old Twitter was a “reduce function”— it tooks  
   people's thoughts, and reduced the size of the set or the list, it  
   compacted them to 140 characters or less.  
   This, of course, is terrible.  
   Thankfully modern Twitter can use 4000 characters.  
   There are many “filter” functions used in modern social media, if you  
   will. There is content censorship.  
   WHAT SHOULD EXIST IS A MAP FUNCTION. A CONSTRUCTIVE MAP FUNCTION.  
   ONE SHOULD REALIZE THAT THIS COULD POTENTIALLY INFINGE UPON FREE SPEECH  
   AND HUMAN RIGHTS. ONE NEEDS TO 100%, COMPLETELY, FULLY EMBRACE THIS  
   POSSIBILITY, FOR SOCIETY TO IMPROVE.  
   THERE HAS BEEN NO “MAP” FUNCTION.  
   THERE HAS BEEN NO FUNCTION TO POSITIVELY TRANSFORM TEXT.  
   THAT IS WHAT THIS _IS_ AND THAT IS WHAT THIS IDEA _IS_.  
   THIS IS VERY NECESSARY.  
   VERY NECESSARY.  
   ### 3. Emerald Browser  
  
   A powerful web browser, see “other” folder.  
   ### 4. Left Right.exe  
  
   This is a tool to bring sanity to politics.  
   ![UCA](./images/8.png)  
   It asks for viewpints from a person that see the good things in each  
   political side—left, right, left, right, etc.  
   It then makes a webpage of that and presents all of that.  
   Hopefully this can make people more sane, and less hyper-partisan.  
   ### 5. Prepend Each  
  
   Prepends a string to each line  
   ### 6. Google Speak  
  
   Google speak is really useful. It speaks a statement using the Google  
   Translate voice, which is probably the most authoritative and  
   high-quality text-to-speech voice that exists.  
   It's kind of like “espeak” or similar tools, but it is much better.  
   You need an internet connection for it to work.  
   It is probably limited at 100 characters.  
   ### 7. Find Housing  
  
   This is a nice tool to find housing with.  
   It is a nice, simple command line tool. You enter the minimum and  
   maximum prices, and Kijiji opens with your options.  
   This tool kind of actually helped me to find housing in real life.  
   ### 8. Selectlines  
  
   selectlines shows all nonblank lines from the input  
   Example  
   cat file | selectlines  
   (echo 2; echo; echo; echo) | selectlines  
   => 2  
   The result would be 2, with no blank lines after that  
   ### 9. Autocorrect  
  
   Command line offline non-AI free software BSD licensed autocorrect  
   using words file.  
   Work in progress.  
   ### 10. Append Each  
  
   Appends a string to each line  
   ### 11. Processes  
  
   Processes lists all processes with a certain name  
   For example  
   processes sh  
   processes bash  
   processes ruby  
   processes gsub  
   ### 12. Gen Video  
  
   Generates a video from command line arguments.  
   Arguments  
   Usage:  
   outputfile duration-seconds width height song-to-play image-folder fps  
   Optional -s to state the start time of the song.  
   Example ./gen_video -s 30 file.mp4 60 1920 1080 ./mp3.mp3 ./images 30  
   ### 13. Speakcat  
  
   Speak cat is a tool like “cat,” which shows the content of files  
   (technically, it combines the content of files).  
   But speak cat also speaks the text.  
   Which could be useful in some circumstances.  
   It's kind of like “tee” to your ear.  
   ### 14. Speak Cb  
  
   speak_cb speaks the selection of the X11 clipboard over and over.  
   Similar to google_speak  
   Very good to focus.  
   ### 15. Nth Word  
  
   nth_word gets the nth word of each line  
   For example  
   nth_word 3  
   gets the 3rd word of each line  
   ### 16. Last Nth  
  
   Last nth gets the last n lines from input  
   For example  
   last_nth 3  
   Would get the 3rd from the last line  
   ### 17. Emeraldc  
  
   The Ultimate C Preprocessor  
   ### 18. Squeeze  
  
   Squeeze reads all input from stdin, then it prints it back omitting  
   argument 1 line from the front, and argument 2 lines from the back  
   Example  
   squeeze 1 1  
   This would omit the first line and the last line  
   squeeze 5 3  
   This would omit the first 5 lines and the last 3 lines  
   squeeze 2 2 [file] also works, it outputs text to file  
   ### 19. Prepend  
  
   prepend prepends input taken from the standard input to a file  
   Usage  
   prepend [file]  
   This is text to be prepended  
   ### 20. Dictate  
  
   Dictate opens web pages in emerald browser, or in any browser  
   (depending on the environment variable set), by you speaking, instead  
   of typing.  
   There is a mode called c_mode, that allows you to make code from  
   speaking.  
   ### 21. Chat Rb  
  
   This program is excellent.  
   It's essentially a mix of ChatGPT and a shell, such as bash or ZSH.  
   It has a bunch of features.  
   It can display a file or change to a folder just by mentioning it.  
   It outputs chatgpt data to an output folder in home folder and copies  
   it to clipboard  
   To run a shell command, prefix things with “c,” such as c gcc.....  
   ### 22. Big Num  
  
   ![UCA](./images/10.png)  
   ### 23. UCA CLI  
  
   CLI for uca app  
   ### 24. Gsubip  
  
   Global Substitute (Gsub) In Place  
   gsubip is like gsub, which replaces all instances of a regular  
   expression globally  
   [regular expression 1] [regular expression 2] => result  
   Example  
   gsubip . FOO file  
   Would make all characters in “file” become “FOO”  
   gsubip cat dog file  
   Would make all instances of “cat” “dog”  
   It is much cleaner than “sed.”  
   You don't need to have “sed” installed to run this program.  
   It doesn't read from the standard input  
   It takes exactly 3 arguments, no more, no fewer.  
   See also  
        gsub  
   ### 25. Delete  
  
   Recursively delete all files named a certain name.  
   ### 26. Append  
  
   Appends text to file  
   Example  
   append file  
   This is more text to be appended  
   ### 27. Rhyme  
  
   A very powerful music generator program that doesn't use AI.  
    See this channel as an example of potential usage of this public  
   domain content  
   https://www.youtube.com/@LawrenceStevensMusic  
   The music industry is plagued with very foundational problems.  
   For starters, the quality of the discourse in music is very low, and  
   has been from the start of the popularization of modern music, as well  
   as during the era in which classical music was popular and before.  
   People aren't able to fight back, against superficiality and potential  
   deception in messages.  
   One of the greatest problems in the current world is the mainstream  
   scientific establishment, supported and upheld by mainstream academia.  
   To indicate what is already obvious, it exists in the context of a  
   legacy of authoritarianism and a lack of understanding of dynamism.  
   It is not dynamic or forceful, the “results” of it don't change the  
   foundation of society. True free discourse is not supported, especially  
   in regards to the human mind and human well-being and human freedom.  
   These problems should be opposed and fought, it is self-evident that  
   this would be the best use of ones time, for it would lead to true  
   freedom.  
   One excellent way to combat this would be to use the generated songs  
   generated by a computer program called Rhyme, available at  
    https://www.github.com/gregoryc/democracy in the SONGS folder.  
   These are public domain songs generated by non-Artificial Intelligence,  
   just a program that introduces variance, and these hit-home against the  
   status quo and the current state of the mainstream scientific  
   establishment. Taking these songs and making actual songs from such,  
   such as rap songs using a service such as Uberduck (no affiliation),  
   would be an excellent, excellent use of time.  
   The mainstream scientific establishment and mainstream academia must be  
   forced to change.  
   Shoving art and flippant content in ones face, is the best way of doing  
   such.  
   Accountability must always be brought about.  
   Is music good and desired? For sure.  
   USAGE OF PROGRAM  
   Enter basename to make songs folder in (folder/songs, num songs =  
   13000)  
   Usage rhyme [folder] (processes files “1.json” and “21.json” by  
   default)  
   Example output of a song  
   ![UCA](./images/7.png)  
   (NO COPYRIGHT RESTRICTIONS ON THIS CONTENT WHATSOEVER. FULLY PUBLIC  
   DOMAIN)  
   Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively  
   influence culture

   ### 28. Lines  
  
   Lines gets the number of files in the current folder that you are in.  
   It can also act like “wc -l” if you pipe data into it.  
   ### 29. Floor  
  
   Gets the floor of numbers e.g. 21.3 -> 21  
   ### 30. Emoji  
  
   Emoji converts words to emojis from the standard input  
   It can also speak the output  
   It can also copy the output to your clipboard  
   It is very useful  
   ![UCA](./images/6.png)  
   ### 31. Email  
  
   This currently doesn't work for gmail since 2022 due to policy changes.  
   A simple and practical tool to email people using Himalaya  
   Himalaya needs to be installed first  
   You would need to configure the script by changing its source code.  
   Modes  
   email [no arguments]  
   email [yourself]  
   email [addr]  
   email one email address  
   email [Subject] [addr] [option more addrs]  
   Example  
   email 'Gregory, I love your software!' gregorycohen2@gmail.com  
   my_friend@outlook.com person@example.com  
   ### 32. Close  
  
   “Close” is a simple program that closes “Emerald Browser,” a new web  
   browser based on the same engine as Chrome. Currently, Emerald Browser  
   only works on Linux and Mac (Or Windows with Windows Subsystem for  
   Linux or a Virtual Machine, but getting it to work might be tricky).  
   “close” closes the Web Browser, which is normally full-screen.  
   More accurately, it kills the browser, and all other copies of Emerald  
   Browser.  
   Since they are normally full screen, presumably the user would only  
   have one instance of the browser open.  
   The browser can have multiple panes (kind of like tabs) open, depending  
   on how the browser is compiled.  
   The browser can also be transparent, depending on how it is compiled.  
   “Close” is supposed to be used in tandem with “open,” which is a  
   command line tool to open the browser.  
   open [query] ——> [query] gets searched in google, and then opened  
   When you are done, you can do  
   close  
   Which closes the browser. It is a simple command.  
   Currently, Emerald Browser is incomplete. A program exists in this  
   software project that allows you to open up multiple browser tabs (one  
   or more tabs) simply by speaking.  
   Voice recognition would google the multiple sites that you say in your  
   query (separated by “and”)  
   “facebook and youtube and google”  
   It's hard to get more direct than that!  
   Emerald browser has a built in the top. The terminal is the navigation  
   bar.  
   Some more work needs to be put into the browser.  
   Currently, new tabs can't be opened, which might be a dealbreaker for  
   some people.  
   Currently, content, like YouTube videos, can't be made fullscreen.  
   If anyone wants to contribute, feel free to!  
   ### 33. Clock  
  
   clock is useful  
   clock is a command line alarm clock  
   It wakes you up at 8:14, or at a time specified  
   Usage  
   clock  
   Runs clock  
   clock 15 30  
   Sets an alarm clock for 3:30pm  
   clock 9 0  
   Sets an alarm clock for 9 in the morning  
   It uses flite to wake you up  
   It speaks with a bunch of voices  
   To stop it  
   Run this command  
   clock stop  
   ### 34. Trim  
  
   Trims spaces of each line  
   ### 35. Swap  
  
   Swaps two files  
   Example  
   swap text1 text2  
   ### 36. Rsub  
  
   Recursively replaces text.  
   Verbosely tells you everything that happens.  
   Non-regex.  
   Example  
   rsub my_email@site.com my_second_email@site.com  
   Would replace an email recursively in a directory.  
   It tries to skip non-text files and hidden files.  
   rsub find replace [optional list of files instead of recursive search]  
   If a file is “-” or stdin, read from stdin and output to stdout.  
   -n, -r, rename files instead of replacing contents of files. find and  
   replace in file and dir names instead  
   -v, verbose mode  
   -- Indicate end of options.  
   ### 37. Rnip  
  
   Replace Not In Place  
   This is like gsub, but for strings, not for regular expressions  
   Example  
   echo .......... | rnip foo bar  
   See also  
        gsub  
   ### 38. Quot  
  
   Turns quotes in text into good text and makes text presentable.  
   Example  
   $ echo 'Joe said,        "One two three".' | quot  
   Joe said, “One two three.”  
   Example 2  
   quot < essay  
   Example 3  
   (Quote the file and output it)  
   quot text_file  
   ### 39. Open  
  
   “open” is a very efficient program that searches a query from google,  
   and then opens it in Emerald Browser.  
   If you ever want something to “just open,” you can use it.  
   Example  
   open “cats”  
   An earlier version of open worked like this  
   open [site1] [site2] [site3] N  
   site1, site2, and site3 would all be opened, and the top N queries were  
   all shown in different panes  
   An even earlier version of this program used Chrome to open the sites.  
   The current version can open one or more sites.  
   Example  
   open “cats” “dogs” “frogs”  
   All of those queries would open in Emerald Browser.  
   Just make sure it is compiled in multipane mode if you want to open  
   multiple new sites at the same time.

   ### 40. News  
  
   Gets the news from bbc  
   Usage  
   news  
   news speak  
   uses google_speak to SPEAK the news, one story at a time.

   ### 41. Gsub  
  
   Gsub is very powerful.  
   Usage  
   gsub [regular expression] [replacement text]  
   Example  
   cat text | gsub man dog  
   cat text | gsub 'man|boy|cat|dog' food  
   ls | gsub Desktop cat  
   ### 42. Ctit  
  
   Capitalize Title  
   A work in progress.  
   Capitalizes arguments and treats them like a title.  
   ctit this is my heading  
   ==> This Is My Heading for a Document  
   You can also do  
   ctit .... | copy  
   To copy the title to your clipboard  
   ### 43. Copy  
  
   copy copies the standard input  
   Example  
   ls | copy  
   ### 44. Args  
  
   args is like a better xargs  
   args works properly with spaces in the name of commands  
   It takes exactly one argument  
   Example  
   ls | args “mv -t ../f”  
   ### 45. Sub  
  
   Sub is a simple command line program that subtracts integers.  
   For some reason, no simple program did this.  
   Which is weird  
   Example  
   sub  
   (Input)  
   10  
   3  
   1  
   Result =>  
   6  
   Example  
   (echo 5; echo 2) | sub  
   Result =>  
   3  
   ### 46. Rip  
  
   Replace In Place  
   rip tool replaces a string, not a regular expression, with another  
   string  
   Example  
   rip cat dog file  
   ### 47. Nth  
  
   Nth gets the nth line from the input  
   ### 48. Mul  
  
   Multiply numbers  
   echo 1 > file  
   echo 2 >> file  
   echo 3 >> file  
   echo 4 >> file  
   echo 5 >> file  
   cat file | mul  
   => 120  
   ### 49. Exp  
  
   exp is an exponentiation tool  
   (echo 5; echo 3) | exp  
   => 125  
   (echo 2; echo 10) | exp  
   => 1024  
   ### 50. Div  
  
   Divides numbers  
   Example  
   (echo 5000; echo 100) | div  
   => 50  
   ### 51. Add  
  
   See the sub example  
   add adds integers from the standard input  
   (echo 1; echo 2; echo 3) | add  
   The result would be 6  
   ### 52. Abs  
  
   Abs gets the absolute value of an integer  
   The absolute value of a number is the value of that number without its  
   sign  
   echo -300 | abs  
   => 300  
   echo 200 | abs  
   => 200  
   (echo -2; echo -10) | sub | abs  
   => 12  
   The last one would do -2 - -10, the result would be -12, and then the  
   absolute value would be computed, and so the result would be 12.  
   ### 53. G+  
  
   A compiler for C += 2. If you want to use C++ with Python syntax, you  
   can use this.  
   Usage is like g++  
   Example  
   g+ a.cpp -o out  
   See also README file & emerald-browser and its source  
   ### 54. T  
  
   “t” is incredibly useful.  
   It can be used many, many times every day by computer power users.  
   It is kind of like “sed,” or perl, python or ruby.  
   It's the ULTIMATE shell “glue” tool.  
   t reads every line from the standard input, and for every line, it  
   evaluates a ruby expression  
   t a + 2  
   would add 2 to every line  
   Number automatically get converted to numbers in Ruby.  
   So one doesn't have to worry about that.  
   The “value” of the line of STDIN is any letter of the alphabet.  
   So choose any letter to do operations on and it will work.  
   You can also do  
   t a + 2 if a % 2 == 0  
   And you get a Python list comprehension sort of thing from the command  
   line  
   It is a lot simpler and easier than using awk, Ruby, Perl or Python  
   You could also have loops  
   echo “One line” | t a while true  
   The second line, again is a Ruby expression.  
   You can have really complex expressions on the second line.  
   You can even import modules.  
   cat /usr/share/dict/words | t 'a + “ is a good word.”'  
   That processes every word in the dictionary, and says that every word  
   “is a good word.”  
   There are other programs in this software project like “t.”  
   But if you do command line text filtering, t might be the best tool  
   that you will find.
