Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
