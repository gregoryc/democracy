VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
