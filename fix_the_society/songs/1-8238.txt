Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
