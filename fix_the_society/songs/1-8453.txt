Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
