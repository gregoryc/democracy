Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
