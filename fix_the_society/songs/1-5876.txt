Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
