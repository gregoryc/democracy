Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
