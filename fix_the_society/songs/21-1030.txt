Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
