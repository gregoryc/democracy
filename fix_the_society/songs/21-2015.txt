Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
