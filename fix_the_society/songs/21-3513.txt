Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
