Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
