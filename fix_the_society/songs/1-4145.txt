Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
