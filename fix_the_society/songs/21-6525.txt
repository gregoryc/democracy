Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
