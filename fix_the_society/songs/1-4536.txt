Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Evading conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
