Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
