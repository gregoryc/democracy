Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
