Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
