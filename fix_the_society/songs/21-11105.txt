Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
