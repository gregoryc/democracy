VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too insidious for many to detect

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
