Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
