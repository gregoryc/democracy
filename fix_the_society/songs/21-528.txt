Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
