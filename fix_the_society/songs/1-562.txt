Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard

Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
