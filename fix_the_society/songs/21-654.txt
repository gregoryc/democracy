Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
