Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
