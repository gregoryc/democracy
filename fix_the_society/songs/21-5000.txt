Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
