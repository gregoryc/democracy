Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
