Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, they completely neglect

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
