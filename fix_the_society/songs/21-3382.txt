Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
