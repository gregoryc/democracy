Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
