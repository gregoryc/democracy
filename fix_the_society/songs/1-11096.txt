Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
