Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
