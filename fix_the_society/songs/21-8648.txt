Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
