VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
