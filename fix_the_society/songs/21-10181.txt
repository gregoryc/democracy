Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
