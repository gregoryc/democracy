Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
