Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
