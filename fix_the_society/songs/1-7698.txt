Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
