Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
