Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
