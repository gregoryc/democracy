Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
