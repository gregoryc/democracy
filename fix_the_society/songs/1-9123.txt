Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
