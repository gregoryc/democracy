Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave

The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
