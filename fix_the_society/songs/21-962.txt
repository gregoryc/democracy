Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
