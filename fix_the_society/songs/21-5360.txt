Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
