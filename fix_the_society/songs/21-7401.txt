Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
