Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
