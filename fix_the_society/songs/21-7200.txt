Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
