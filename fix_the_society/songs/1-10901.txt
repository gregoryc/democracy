Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
