Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
