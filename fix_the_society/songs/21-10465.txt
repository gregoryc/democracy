Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
