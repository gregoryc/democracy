Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
