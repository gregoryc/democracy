Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
