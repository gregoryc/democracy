Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
