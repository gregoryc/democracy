Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt

An open conversation, they always divert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
