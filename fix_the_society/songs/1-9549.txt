Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They hate themselves, they do not respect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They hate themselves, they do not respect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
