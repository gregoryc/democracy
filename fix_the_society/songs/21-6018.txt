Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
