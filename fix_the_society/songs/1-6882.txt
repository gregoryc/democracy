Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
