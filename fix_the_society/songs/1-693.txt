Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
