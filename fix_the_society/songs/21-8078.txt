Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS
