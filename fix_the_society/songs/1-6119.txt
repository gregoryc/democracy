Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
