Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
