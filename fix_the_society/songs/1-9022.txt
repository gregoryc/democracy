Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
