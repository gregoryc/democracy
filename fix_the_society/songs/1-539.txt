Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
