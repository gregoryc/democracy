Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
