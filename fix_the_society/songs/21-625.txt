Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
