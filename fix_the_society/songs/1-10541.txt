Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
