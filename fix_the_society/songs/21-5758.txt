Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
