Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They make broad statements while looking like a kid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
I must speak here, I must interject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They make broad statements while looking like a kid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They make broad statements while looking like a kid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
