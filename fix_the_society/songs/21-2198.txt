Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
