Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
I must speak here, I must interject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is plain, anyone can detect
I must speak here, I must interject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
