Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
