Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
