VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

The society is the ones who hurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
