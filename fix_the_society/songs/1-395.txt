Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
