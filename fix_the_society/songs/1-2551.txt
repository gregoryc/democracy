VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
