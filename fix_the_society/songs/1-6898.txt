Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, they act like a kid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
