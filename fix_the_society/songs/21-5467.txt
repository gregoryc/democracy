Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
