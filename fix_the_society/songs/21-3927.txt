Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
