VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The state of science is, wholly inert
An open conversation, they always divert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The state of science is, wholly inert
An open conversation, they always divert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
