Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
