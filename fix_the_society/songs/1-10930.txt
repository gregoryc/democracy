Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
