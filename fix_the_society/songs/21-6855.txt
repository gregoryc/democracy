Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
