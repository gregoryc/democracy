Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They make broad claims while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
