VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
