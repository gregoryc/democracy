Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
