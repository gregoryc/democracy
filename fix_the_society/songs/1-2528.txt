Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
