Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
