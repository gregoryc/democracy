Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
