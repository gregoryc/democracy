Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and crying like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
