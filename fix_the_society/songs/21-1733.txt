Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
