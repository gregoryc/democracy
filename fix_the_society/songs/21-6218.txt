Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
