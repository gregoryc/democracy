Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
