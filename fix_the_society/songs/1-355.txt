Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Science is  fundamentally inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
