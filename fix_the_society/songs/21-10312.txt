Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
