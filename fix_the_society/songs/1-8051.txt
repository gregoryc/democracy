Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
