Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
