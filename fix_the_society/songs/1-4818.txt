Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is obvious, anyone can detect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is plain, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
