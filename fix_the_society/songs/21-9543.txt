Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
