Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Science is  fundamentally inert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
