Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
