Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
I must speak here, I must interject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
