Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
