Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't think, you act like a kid

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
