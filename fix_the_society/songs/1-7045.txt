Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is too insidious for many to detect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred

Their own principles are something they do not respect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
