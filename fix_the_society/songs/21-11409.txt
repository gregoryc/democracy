Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
