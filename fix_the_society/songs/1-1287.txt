Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
