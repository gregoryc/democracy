Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
