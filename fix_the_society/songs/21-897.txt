Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
