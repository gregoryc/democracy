Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
