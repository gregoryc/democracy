Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
