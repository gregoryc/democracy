Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
