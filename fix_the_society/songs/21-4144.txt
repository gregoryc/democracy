Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
