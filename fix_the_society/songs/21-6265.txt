Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
