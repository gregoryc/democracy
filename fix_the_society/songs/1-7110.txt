Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
