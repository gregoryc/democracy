Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
