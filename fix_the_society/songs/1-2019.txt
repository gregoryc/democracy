Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
