Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

If you talk to them they miss the subject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The state of science is, wholly inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

If you talk to them they miss the subject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
