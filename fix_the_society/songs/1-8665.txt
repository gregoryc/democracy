Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Evading conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Evading conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
