Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
