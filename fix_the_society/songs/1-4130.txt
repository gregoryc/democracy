Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
I must speak here, I must interject

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They do junk, they do dirt

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
