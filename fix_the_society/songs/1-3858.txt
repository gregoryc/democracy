Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
