Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
