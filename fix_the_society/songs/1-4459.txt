VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
