Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
