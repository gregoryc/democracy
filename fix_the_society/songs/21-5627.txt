Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
