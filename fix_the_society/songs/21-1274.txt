Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
