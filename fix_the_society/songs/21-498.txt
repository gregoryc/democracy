Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
