Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
