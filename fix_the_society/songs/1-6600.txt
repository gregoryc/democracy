Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
