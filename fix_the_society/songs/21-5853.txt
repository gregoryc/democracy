Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
