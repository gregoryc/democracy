Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

I must speak here, I must interject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS
