Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
I must speak here, I must interject

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
