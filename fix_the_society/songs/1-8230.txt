Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Science is  fundamentally inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
