Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The state of science is, wholly inert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their minds, they cannot exert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You make broad claims while looking like a kid

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
