Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
