Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
