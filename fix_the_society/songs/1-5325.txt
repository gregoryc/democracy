Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
