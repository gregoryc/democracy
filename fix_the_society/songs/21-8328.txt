Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
