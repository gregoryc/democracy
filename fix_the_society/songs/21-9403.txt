Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
