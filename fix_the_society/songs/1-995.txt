Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
I must speak here, I must interject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
