Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
