Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave

Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
