Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
