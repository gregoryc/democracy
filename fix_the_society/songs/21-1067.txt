Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
