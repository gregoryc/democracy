Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
