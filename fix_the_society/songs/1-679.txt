Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
