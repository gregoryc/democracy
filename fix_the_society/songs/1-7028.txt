Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
