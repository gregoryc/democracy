Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
