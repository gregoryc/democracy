Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
The society is the ones who hurt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
