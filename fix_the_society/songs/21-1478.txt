Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
