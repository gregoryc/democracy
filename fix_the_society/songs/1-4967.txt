Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
