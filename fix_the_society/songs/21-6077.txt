Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
