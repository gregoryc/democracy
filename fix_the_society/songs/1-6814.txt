Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
