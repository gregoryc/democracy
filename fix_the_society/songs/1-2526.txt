Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
