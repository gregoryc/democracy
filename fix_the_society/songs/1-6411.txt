Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
