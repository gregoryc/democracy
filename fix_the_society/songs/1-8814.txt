Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
