Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
