Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The state of science is, wholly inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
