Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
