Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
