Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
