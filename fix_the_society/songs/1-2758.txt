Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
