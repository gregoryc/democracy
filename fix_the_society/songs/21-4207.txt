Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
