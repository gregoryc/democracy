Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
