Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
