Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
