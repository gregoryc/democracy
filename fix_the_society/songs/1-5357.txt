Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
