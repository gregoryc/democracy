Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
