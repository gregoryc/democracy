Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
