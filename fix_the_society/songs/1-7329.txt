Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Running away from conversation just like a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
