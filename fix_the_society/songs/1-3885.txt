Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
