Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
