Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
