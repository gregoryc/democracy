Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
