Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
