Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
