Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
