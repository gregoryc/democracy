Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
