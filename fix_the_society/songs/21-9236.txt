Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
