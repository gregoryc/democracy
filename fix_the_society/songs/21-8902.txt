Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
