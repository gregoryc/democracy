Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
