Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
