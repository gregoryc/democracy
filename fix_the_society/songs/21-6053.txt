Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
