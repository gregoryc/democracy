Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
