Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
