VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
