Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Science is  fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
