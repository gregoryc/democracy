Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
