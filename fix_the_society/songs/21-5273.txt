Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
