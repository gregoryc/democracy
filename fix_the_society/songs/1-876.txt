Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, you act like a kid

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, you act like a kid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, you act like a kid

VERSE

This is too insidious for many to detect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
