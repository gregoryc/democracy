Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
An open conversation, they always divert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
