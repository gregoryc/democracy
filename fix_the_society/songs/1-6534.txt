Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
