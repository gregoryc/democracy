Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
