Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
