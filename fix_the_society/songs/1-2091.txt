Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Evading conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

An open conversation, they always divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
