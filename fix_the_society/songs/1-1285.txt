VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
