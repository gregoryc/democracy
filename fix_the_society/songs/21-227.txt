Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
