Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
