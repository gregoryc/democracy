Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
