Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
