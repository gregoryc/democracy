Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
