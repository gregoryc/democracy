VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

This is plain, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

This is plain, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
