Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
