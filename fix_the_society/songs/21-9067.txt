Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
