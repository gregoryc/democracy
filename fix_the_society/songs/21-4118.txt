Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
