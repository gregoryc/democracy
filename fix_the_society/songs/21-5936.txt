Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
