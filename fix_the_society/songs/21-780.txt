Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
