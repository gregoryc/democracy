Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

I must speak here, I must interject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
