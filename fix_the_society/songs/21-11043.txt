Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
