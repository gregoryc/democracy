VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
