Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
