Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
