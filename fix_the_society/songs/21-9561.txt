Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
