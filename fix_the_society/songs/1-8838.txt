Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
