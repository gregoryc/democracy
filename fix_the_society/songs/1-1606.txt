Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They hate themselves, they do not respect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
