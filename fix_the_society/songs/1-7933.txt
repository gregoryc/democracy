VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
