Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
