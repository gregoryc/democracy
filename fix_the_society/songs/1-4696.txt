Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
