Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
