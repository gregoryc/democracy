Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
