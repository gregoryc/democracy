Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
