Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
