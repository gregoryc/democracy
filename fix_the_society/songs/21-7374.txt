Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
