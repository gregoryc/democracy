Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
