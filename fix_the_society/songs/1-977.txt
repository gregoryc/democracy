Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They do junk, they do dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Science is  fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
