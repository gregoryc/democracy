Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

You don't think, they act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
