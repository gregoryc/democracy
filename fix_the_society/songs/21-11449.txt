Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
