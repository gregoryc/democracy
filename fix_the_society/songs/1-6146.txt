Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, you act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

VERSE

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
You don't think, you act like a kid

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
