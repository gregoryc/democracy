Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
