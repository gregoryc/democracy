Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
