Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
