Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
