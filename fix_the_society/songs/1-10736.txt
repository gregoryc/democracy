Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society itself, you completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
