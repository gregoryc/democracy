Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
