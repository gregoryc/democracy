Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
