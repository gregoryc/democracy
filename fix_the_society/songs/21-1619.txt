Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
