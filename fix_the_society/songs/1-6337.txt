Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Science is  fundamentally inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
