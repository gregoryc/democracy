Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
