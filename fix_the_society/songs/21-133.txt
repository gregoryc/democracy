Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
