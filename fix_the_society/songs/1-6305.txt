Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
