Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
