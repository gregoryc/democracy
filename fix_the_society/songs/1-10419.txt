Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
