Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
