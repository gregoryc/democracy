Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
