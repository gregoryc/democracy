Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
