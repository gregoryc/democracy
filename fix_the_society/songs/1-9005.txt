Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid

CHORUS

They do junk, they do dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

They do junk, they do dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They do junk, they do dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They do junk, they do dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
