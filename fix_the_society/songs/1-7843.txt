Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their own principles are something they do not respect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their own principles are something they do not respect

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
