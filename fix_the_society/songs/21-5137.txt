Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
