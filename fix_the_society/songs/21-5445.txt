Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
