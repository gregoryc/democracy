Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
