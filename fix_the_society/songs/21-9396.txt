Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
