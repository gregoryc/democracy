VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is plain, anyone can detect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
