Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
