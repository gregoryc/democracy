Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
