Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
