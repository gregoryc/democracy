Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
