Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
