Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
