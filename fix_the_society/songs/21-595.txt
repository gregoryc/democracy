Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
