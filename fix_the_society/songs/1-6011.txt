Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
