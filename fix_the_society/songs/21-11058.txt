Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
