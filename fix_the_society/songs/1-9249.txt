Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Science is  fundamentally inert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
