VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
