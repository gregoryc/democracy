Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
