Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
