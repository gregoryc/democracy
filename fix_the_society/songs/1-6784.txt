Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
