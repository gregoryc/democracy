Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not alright

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
