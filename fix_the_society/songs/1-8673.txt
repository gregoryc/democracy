VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
