VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
