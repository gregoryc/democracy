Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
