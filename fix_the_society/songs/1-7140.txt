Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too insidious for many to detect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
