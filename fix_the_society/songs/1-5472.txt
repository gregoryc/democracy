Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
