Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
