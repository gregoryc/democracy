Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
