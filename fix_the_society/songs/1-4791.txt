Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is wholesale, in every aspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is wholesale, in every aspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
