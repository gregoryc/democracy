Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
