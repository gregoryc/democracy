Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
