Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
