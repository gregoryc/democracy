Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
