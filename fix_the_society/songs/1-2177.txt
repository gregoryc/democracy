Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
