Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
