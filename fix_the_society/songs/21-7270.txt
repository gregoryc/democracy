Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
