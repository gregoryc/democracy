Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
