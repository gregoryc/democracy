Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
