Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
