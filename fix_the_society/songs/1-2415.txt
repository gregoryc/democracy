Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
