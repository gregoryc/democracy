Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
