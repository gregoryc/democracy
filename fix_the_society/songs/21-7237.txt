Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
