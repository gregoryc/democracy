Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
