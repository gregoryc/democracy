Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
