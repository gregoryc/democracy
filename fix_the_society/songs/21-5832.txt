Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
