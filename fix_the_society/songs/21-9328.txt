Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
