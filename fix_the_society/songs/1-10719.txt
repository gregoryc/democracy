Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave

Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
