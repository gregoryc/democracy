Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
