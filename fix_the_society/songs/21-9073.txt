Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
