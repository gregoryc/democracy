Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
