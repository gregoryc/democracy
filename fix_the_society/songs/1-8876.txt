Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
