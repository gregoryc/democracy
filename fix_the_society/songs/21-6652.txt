Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
