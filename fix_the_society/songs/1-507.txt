VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
