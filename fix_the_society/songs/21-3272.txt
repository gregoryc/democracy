Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
