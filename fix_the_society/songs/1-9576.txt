VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
