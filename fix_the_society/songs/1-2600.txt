Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
