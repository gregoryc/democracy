VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
