Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
