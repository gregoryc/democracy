Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
