Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
