Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
