Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
