Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
