Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
