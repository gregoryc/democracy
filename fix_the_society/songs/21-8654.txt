Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
