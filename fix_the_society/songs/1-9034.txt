Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
