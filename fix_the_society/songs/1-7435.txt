VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
