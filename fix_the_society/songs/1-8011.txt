Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

CHORUS

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
