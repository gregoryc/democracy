Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
