VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
