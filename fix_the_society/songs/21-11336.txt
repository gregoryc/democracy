Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
