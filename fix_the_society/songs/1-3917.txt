Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

They don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The state of science is, wholly inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

They don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is plain, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

They don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
