Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

CHORUS

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
