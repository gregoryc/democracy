Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
