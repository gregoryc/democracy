Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
