Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
