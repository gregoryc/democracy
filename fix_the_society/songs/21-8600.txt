Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
