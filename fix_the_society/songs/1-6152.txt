Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
