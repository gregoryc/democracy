Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
