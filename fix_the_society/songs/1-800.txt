Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
