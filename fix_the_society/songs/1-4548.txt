Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
