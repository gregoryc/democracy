Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
