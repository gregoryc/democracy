Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
