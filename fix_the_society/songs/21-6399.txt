Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
