Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
