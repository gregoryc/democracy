Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
