Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
