Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
