VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
I must speak here, I must interject

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
