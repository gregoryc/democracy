Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
