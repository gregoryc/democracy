Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
I must speak here, I must interject

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
