Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
