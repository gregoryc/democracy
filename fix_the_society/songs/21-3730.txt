Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
