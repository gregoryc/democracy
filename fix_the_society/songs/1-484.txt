Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

No one will be unhurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

No one will be unhurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
