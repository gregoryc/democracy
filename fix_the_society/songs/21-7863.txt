Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
