Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
