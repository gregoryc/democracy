Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
