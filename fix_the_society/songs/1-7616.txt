Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
