Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
