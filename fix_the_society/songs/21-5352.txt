Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
