Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
