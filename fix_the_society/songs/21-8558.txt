Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
