Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
