Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
