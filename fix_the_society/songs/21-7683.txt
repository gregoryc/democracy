Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
