VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
