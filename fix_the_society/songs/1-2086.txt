Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
An open conversation, they always divert

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
