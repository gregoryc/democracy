VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
