Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
