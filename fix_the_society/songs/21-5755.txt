Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
