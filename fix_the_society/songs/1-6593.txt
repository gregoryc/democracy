Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
