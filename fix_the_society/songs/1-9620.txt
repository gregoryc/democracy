Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
