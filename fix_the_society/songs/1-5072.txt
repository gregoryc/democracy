Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Science is  fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
