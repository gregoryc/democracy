Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
