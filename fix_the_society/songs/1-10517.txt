VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
