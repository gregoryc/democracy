Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
