Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
