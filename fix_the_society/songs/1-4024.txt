Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
