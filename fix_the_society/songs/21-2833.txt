Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
