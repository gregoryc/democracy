Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
