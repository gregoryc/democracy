VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
