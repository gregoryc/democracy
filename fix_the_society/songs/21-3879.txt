Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
