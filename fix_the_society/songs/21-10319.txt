Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
