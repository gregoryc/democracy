Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
