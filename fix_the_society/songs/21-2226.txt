Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
