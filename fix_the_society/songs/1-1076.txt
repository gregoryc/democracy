Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Whining and complaining like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
I must speak here, I must interject

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
