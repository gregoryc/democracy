Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The society is the ones who hurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
