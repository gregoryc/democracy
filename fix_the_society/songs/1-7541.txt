Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They hate themselves, they do not respect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
