Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
