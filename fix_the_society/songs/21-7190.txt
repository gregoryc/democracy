Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
