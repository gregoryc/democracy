Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
