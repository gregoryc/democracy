Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They hate themselves, they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They hate themselves, they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
