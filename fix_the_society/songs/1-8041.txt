Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
