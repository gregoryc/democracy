Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
