Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
