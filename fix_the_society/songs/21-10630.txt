Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
