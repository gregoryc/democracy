Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
