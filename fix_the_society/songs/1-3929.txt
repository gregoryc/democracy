Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
