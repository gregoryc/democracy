Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
