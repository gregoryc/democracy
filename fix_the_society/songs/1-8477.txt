Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
