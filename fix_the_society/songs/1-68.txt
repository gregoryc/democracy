Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save

An open conversation, they always divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The state of science is, wholly inert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
