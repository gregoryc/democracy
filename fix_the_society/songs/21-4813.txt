Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
