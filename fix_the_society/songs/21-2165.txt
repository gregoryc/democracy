Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
