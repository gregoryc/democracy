Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
