Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
