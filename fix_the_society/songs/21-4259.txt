Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
