Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert

The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
