Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
