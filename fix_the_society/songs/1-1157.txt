Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and complaining like a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and complaining like a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and complaining like a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and complaining like a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
