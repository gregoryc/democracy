VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
