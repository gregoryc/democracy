Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
