Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
