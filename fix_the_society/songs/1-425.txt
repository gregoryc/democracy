Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
