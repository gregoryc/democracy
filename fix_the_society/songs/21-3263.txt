Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
