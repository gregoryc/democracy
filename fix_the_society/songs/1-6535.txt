Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard

The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard

The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
I must speak here, I must interject

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
