Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
