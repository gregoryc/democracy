Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
