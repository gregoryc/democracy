Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
