Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
