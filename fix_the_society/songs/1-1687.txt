Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
