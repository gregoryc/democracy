Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
