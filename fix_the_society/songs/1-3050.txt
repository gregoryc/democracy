Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
