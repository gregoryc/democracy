Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
