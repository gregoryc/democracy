Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and crying like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
