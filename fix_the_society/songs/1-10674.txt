Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
