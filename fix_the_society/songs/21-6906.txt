Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
