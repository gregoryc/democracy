Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
