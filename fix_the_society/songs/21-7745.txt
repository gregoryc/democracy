Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
