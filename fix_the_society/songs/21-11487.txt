Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
