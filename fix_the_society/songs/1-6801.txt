Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, you act like a kid

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, you act like a kid

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, you act like a kid

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
