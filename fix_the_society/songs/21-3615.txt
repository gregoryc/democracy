Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
