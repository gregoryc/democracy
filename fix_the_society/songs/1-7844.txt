Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
