Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
