Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
