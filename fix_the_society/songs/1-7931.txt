Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This is too insidious for many to detect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
