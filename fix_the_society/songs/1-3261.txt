Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
