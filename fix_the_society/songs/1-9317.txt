Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
An open conversation, they always divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
