Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
