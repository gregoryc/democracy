Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
