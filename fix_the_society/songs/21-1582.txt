Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
