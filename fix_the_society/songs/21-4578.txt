Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
