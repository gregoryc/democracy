Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
