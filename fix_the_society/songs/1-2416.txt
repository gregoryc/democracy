Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
