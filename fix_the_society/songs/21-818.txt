Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
