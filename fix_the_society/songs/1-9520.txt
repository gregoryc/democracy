Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Playing only the worst card

The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect
