Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
