Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
