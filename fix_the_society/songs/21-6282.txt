Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
