Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
