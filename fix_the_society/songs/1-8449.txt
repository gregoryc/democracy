Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, they act like a kid

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
