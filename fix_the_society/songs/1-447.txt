Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

The results are horrible, just look at the effect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect

I must speak here, I must interject

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
