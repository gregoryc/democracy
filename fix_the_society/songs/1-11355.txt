Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
