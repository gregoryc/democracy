Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
