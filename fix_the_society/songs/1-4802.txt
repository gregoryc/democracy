Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
