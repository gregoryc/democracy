Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
