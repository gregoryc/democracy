Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
