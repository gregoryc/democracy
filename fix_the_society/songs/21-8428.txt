Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
