Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The state of science is, wholly inert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
