Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
