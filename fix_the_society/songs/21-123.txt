Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
