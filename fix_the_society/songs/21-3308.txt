Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
