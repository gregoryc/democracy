Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
