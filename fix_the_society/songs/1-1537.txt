Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
