Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
