Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
