Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
