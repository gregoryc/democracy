Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
