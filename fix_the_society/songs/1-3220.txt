Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
