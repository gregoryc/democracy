Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
