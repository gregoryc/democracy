Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
