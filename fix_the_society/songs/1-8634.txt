VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
