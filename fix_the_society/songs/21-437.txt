Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
