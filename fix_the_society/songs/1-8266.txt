Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is too insidious for many to detect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is too insidious for many to detect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is too insidious for many to detect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
