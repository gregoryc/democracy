Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
