Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
