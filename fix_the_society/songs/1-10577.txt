Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
