Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
