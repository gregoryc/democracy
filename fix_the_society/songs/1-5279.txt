Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
