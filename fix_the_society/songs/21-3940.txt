Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
