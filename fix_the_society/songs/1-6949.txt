VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
