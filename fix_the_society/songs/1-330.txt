Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card

Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
