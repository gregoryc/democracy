Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

This is too insidious for many to detect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
