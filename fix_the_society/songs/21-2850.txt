Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
