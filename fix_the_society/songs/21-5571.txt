Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
