Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
