Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
