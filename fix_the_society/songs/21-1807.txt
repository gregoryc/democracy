Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
