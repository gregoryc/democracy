Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
