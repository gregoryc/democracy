Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't think, you act like a kid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
