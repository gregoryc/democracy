Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
