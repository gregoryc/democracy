Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
