Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
