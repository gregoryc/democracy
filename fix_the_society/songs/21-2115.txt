Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
