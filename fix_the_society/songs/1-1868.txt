Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

CHORUS

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
