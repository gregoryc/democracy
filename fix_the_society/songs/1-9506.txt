Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
