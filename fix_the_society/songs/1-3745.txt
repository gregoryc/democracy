Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
I must speak here, I must interject
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
