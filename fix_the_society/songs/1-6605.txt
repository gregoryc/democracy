Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Away from the truth they hid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
