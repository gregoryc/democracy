Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
