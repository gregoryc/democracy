Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
