Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
