Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
