Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
