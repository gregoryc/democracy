Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
