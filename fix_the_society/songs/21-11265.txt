Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
