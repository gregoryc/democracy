Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
