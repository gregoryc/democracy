VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
