Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
