Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
