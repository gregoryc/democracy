Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
