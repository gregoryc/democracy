Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
