VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
