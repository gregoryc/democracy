Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Destruction and doom is what they architect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
