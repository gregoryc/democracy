Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
