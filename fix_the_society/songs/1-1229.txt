Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
