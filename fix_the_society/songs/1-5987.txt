Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
