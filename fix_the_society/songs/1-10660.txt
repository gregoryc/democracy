Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
