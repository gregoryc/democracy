Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
