Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
