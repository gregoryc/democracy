Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
