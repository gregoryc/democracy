Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
