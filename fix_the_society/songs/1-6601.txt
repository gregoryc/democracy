Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
