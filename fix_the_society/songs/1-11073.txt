Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
