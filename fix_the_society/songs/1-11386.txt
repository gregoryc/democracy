Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
