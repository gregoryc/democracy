Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
