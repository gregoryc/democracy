Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
