Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
