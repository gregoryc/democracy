Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
