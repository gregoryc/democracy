Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
