Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and crying like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
