Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
