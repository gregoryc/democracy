Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
