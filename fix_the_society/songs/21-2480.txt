Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
