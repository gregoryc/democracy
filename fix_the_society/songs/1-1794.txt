Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
I must speak here, I must interject

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
I must speak here, I must interject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
