Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
