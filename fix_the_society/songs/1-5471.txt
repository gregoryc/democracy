Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

If you talk to them they miss the subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
