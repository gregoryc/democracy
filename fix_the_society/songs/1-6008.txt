Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
