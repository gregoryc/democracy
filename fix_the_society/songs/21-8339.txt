Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
