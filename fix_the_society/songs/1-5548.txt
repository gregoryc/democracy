Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
