Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
