Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
