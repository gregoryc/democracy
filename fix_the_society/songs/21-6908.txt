Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
