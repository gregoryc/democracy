Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
