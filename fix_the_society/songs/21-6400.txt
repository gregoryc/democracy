Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
