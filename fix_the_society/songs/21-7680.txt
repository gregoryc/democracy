Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
