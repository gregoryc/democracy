Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
