Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
