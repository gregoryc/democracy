Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
