Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
