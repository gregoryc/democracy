Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
