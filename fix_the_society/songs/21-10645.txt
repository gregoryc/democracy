Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
