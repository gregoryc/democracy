Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
