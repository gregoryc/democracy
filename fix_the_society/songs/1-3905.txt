Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is plain, anyone can detect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
