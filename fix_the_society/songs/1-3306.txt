Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
