Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

VERSE

Science is  fundamentally inert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
