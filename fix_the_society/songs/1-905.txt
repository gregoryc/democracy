Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
