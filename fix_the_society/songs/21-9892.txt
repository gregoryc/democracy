Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
