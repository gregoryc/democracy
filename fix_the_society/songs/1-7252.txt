Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
