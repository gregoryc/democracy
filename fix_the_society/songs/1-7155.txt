Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect

An open conversation, they always divert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
