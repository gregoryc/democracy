Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
