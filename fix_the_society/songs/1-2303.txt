Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
