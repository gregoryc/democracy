Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
