Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
