Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
