Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
