Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
