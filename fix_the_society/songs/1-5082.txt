Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
