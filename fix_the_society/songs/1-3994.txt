VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS
