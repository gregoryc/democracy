VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
