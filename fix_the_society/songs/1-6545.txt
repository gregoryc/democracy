Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
