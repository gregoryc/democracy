Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
