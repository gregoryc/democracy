Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
