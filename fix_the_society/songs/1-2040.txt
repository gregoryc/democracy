Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

I must speak here, I must interject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
