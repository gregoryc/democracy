Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
