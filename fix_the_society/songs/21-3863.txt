Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
