Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
