Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
