Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
