Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
