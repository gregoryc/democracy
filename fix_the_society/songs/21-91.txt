Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
