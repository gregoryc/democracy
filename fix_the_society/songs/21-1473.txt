Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
