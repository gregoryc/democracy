Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
