Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You make broad claims while acting like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
