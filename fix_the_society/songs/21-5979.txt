Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
