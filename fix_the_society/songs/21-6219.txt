Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
