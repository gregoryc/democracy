Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
