Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
