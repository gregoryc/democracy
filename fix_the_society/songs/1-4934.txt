Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
