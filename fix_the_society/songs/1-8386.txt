VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
