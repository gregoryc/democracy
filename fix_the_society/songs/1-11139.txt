Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
