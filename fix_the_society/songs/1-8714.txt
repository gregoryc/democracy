VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
