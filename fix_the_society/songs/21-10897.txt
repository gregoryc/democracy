Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
