Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
