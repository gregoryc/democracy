Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
