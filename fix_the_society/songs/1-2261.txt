Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
