Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
