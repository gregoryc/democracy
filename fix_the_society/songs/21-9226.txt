Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
