VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
