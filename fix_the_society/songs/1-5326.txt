Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
