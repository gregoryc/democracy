Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
