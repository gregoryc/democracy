Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and moaning like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
