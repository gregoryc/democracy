Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
