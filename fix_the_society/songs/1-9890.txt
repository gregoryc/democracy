VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
