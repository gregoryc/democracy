Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
