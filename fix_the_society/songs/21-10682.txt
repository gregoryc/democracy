Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
