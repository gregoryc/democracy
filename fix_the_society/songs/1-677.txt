Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Don't have to do with ego or id
Running away from conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
