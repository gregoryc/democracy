Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
