Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
