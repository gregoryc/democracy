Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
