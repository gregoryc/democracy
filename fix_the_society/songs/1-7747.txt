Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
