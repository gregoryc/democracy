Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
