Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
