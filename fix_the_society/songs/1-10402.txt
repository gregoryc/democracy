Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
