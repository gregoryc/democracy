Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

This is too insidious for many to detect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
