Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
