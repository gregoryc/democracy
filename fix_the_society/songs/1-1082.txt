Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
I must speak here, I must interject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
