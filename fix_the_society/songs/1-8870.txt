Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't think, you act like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
