Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
