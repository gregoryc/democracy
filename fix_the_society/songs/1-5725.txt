Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
