Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and crying like a kid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Whining and complaining like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
