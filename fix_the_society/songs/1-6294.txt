Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and crying like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
