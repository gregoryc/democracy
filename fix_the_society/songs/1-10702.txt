Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

I must speak here, I must interject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

I must speak here, I must interject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
