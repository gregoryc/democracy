Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
