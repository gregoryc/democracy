Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
