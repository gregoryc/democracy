Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
