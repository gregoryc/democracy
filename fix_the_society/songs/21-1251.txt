Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
