Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
