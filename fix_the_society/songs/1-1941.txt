Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
