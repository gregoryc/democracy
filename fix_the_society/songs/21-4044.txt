Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
