Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
