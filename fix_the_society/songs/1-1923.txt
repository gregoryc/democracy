Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't think, you act like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
