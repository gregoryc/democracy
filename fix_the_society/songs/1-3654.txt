Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
