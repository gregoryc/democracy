Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Reason is what they want to discard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Reason is what they want to discard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
