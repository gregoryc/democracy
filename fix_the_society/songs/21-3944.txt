Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
