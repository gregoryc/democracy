Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
