Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
