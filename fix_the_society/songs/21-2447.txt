Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
