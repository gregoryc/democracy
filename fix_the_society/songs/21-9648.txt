Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
