Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
