Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
