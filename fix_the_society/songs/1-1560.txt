Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
