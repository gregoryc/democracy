Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
