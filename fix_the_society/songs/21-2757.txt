Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
