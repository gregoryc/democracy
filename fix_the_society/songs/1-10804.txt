Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
