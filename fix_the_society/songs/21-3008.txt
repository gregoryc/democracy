Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
