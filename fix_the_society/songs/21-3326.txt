Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
