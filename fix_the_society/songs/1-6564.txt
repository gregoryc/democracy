Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
I must speak here, I must interject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and moaning like a kid

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
I must speak here, I must interject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
