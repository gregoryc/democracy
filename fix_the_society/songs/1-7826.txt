Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
