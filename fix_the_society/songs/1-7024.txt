Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
