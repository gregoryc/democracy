Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
