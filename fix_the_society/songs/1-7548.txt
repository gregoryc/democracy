Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
