Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
