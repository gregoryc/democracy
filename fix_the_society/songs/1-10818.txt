VERSE

This is obvious, anyone can detect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
