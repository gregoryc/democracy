Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
