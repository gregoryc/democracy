Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
