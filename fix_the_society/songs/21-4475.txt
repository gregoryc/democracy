Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
