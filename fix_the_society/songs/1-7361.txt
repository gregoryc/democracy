Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
I must speak here, I must interject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

I must speak here, I must interject

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

This is not right, this is completely incorrect

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
