Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
