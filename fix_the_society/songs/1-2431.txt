Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

CHORUS

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
