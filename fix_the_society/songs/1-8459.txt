Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Reason is what they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Reason is what they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
