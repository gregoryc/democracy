Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
