Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
