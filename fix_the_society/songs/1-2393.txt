Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
