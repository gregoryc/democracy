Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
