Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
