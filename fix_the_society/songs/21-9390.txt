Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
