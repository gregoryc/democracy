Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
