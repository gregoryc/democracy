Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
