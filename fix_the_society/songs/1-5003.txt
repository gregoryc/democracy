Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
