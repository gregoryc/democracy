Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
