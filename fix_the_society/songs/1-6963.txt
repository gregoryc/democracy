Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
