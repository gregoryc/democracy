Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
