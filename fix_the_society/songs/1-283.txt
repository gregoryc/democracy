Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Playing only the worst card

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Playing only the worst card

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
