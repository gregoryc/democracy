Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
