Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
I must speak here, I must interject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
