VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
