Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
