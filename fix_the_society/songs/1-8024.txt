Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
