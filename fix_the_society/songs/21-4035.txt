Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
