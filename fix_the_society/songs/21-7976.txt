Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
