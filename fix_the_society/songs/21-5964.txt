Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
