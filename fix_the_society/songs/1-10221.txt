Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their behavior makes them charred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
