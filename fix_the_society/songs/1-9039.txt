Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
