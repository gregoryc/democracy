Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
