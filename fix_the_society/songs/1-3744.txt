Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
