Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
