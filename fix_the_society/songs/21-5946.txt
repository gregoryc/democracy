Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
