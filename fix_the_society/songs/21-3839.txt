Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
