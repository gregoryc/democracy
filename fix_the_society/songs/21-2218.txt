Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
