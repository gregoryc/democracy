Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
