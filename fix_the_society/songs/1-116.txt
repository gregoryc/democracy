Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, they completely neglect
