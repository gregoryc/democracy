Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

CHORUS

They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Their minds, they cannot exert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
