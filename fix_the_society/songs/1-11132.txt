Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
