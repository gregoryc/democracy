Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
