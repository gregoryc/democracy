Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

VERSE

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Stop this already, time to get rid

Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
