Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
