Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
