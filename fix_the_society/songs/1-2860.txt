Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
