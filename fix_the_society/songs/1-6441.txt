Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
