Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
