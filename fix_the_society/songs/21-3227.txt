Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
