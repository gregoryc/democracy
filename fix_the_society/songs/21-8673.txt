Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
