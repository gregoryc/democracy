Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
