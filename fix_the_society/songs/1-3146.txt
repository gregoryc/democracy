Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
