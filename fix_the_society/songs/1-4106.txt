Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
