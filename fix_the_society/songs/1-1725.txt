Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
