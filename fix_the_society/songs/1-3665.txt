VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Whining and crying like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
