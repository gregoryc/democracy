Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
