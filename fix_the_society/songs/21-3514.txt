Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
