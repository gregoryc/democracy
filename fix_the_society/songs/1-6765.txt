Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
