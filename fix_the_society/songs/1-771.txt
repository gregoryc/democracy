Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The state of science is, wholly inert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
