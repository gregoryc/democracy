Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
