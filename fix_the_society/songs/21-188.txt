Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
