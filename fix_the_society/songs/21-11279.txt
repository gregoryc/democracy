Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
