Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
