Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
