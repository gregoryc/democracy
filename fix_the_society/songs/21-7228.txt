Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
