Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
