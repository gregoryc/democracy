Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
