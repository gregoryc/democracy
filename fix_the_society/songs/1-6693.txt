Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

This is too insidious for many to detect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
