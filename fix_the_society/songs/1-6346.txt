Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
