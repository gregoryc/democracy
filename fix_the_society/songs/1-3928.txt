Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
