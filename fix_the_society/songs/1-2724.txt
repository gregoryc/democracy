Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave

Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
