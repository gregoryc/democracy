Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert

Their own principles are something they do not respect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
