Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
