Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
