Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
