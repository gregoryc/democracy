Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
