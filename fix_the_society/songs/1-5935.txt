Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
