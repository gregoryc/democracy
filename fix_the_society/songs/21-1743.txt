Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
