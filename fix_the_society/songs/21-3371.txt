Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
