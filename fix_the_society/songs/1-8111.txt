Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
