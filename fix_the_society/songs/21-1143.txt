Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
