Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
