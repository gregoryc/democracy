Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
