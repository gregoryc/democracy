Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
