Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
