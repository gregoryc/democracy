Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They do junk, they do dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
