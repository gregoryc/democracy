Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
