Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
