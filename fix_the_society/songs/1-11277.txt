VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too insidious for many to detect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
