Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
