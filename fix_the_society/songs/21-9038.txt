Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
