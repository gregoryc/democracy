Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
