Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
