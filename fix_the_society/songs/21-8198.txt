Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
