Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
I must speak here, I must interject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
