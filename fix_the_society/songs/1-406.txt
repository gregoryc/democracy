VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
