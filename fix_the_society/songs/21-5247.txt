Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
