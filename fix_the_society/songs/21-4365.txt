Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
