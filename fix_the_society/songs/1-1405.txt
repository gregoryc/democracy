Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
