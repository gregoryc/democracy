Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
