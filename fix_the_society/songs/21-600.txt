Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
