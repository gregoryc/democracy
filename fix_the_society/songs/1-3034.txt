Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
