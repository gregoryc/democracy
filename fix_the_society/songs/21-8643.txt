Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
