Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
