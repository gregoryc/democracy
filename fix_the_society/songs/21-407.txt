Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
