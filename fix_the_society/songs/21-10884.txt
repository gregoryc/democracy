Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
