Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
