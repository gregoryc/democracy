Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Science is  fundamentally inert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
