Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
