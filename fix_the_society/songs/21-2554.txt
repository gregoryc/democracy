Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
