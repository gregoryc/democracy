Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
