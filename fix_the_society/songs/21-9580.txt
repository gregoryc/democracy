Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
