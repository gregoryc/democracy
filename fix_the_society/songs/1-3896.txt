Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Away from the truth they hid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
