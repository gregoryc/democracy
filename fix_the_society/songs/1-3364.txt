VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
