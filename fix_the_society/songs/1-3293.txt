Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Science is  fundamentally inert

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
