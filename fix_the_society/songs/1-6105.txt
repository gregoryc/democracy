Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They do junk, they do dirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
