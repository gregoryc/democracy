Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

I must speak here, I must interject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
