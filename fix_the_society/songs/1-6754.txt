Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
