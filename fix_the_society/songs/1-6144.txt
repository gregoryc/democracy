Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
