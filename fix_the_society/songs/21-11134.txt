Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
