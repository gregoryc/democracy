Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
