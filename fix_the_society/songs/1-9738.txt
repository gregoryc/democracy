Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
