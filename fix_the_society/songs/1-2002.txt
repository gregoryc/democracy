Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
