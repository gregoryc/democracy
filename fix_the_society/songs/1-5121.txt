Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
