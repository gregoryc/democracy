Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The state of science is, wholly inert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
