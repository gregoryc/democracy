Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior makes them charred
