Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
