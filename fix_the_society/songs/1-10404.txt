Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
