Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
