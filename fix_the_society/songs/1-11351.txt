Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
