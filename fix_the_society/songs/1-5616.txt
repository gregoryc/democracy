VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
