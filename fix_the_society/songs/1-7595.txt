VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
