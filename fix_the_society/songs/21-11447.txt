Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
