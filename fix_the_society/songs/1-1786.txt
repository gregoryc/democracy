VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
