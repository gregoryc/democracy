VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
I must speak here, I must interject

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
