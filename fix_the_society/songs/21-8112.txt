Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
