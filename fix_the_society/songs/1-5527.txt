Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

You don't think, you act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
