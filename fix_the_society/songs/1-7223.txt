Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
