Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Science is  fundamentally inert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
