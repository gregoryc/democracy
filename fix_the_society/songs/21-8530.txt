Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
