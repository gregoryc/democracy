Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
