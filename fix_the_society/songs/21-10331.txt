Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
