Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
