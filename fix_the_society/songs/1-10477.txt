Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
