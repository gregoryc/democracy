Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
