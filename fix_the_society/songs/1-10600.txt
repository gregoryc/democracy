Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They do junk, they do dirt

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They do junk, they do dirt

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
