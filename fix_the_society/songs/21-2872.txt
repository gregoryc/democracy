Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
