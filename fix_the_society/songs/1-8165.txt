Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
I must speak here, I must interject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
