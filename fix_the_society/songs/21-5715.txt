Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
