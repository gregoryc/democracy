Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
