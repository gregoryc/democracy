Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
I must speak here, I must interject

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
