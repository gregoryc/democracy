Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
