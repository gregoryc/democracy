Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
