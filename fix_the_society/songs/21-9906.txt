Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
