Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
