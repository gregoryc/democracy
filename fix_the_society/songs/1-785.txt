VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
