Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
