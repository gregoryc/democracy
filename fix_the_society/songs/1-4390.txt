Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They do junk, they do dirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
