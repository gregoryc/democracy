Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
