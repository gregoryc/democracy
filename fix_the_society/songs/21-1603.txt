Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
