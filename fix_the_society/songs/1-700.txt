Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
