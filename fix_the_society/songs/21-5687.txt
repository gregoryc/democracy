Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
