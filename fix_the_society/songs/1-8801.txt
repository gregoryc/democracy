Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
