Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
