Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
