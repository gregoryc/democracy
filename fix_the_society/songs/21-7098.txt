Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
