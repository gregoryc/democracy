Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The state of science is, wholly inert
