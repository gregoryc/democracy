Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
