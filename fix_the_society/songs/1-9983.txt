Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
