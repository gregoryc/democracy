Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
