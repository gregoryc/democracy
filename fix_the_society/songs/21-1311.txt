Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
