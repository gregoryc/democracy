Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
