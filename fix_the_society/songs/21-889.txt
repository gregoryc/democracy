Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
