Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
