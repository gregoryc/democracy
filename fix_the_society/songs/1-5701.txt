VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
