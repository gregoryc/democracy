Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
