Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
