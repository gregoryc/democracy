Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
