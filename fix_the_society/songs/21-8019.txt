Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
