Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
