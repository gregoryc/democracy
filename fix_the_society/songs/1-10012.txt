Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
