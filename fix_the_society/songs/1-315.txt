Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
