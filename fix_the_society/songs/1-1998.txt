Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
