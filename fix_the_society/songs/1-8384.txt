Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
