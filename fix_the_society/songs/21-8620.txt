Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
