Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
