Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
