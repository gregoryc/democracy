Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
