Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
