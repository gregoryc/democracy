Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
