Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
