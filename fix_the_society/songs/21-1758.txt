Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
