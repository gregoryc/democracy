Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
