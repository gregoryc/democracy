VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
