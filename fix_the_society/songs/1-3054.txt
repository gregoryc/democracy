Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
