Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
