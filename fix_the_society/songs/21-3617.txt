Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
