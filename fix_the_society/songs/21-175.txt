Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
