Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

This is too insidious for many to detect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is plain, anyone can detect
I must speak here, I must interject

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
