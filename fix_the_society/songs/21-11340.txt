Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
