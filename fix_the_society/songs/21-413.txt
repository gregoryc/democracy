Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
