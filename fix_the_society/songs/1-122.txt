Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
