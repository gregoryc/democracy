Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
