Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
