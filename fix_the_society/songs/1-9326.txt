Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
