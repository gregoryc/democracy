Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is plain, anyone can detect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Science is  fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Evading conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
