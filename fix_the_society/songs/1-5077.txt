Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
