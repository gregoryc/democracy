Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
