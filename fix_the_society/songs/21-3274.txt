Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
