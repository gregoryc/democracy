Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
