Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

You don't think, they act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
