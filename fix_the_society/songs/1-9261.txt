Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
