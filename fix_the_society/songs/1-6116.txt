Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
