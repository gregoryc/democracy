Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
