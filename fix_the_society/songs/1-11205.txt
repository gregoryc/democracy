Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
