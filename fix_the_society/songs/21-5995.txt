Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
