Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
