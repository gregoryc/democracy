Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
