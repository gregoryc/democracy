Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
