Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
