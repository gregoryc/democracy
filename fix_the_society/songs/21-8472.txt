Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
