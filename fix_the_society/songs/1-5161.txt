Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
