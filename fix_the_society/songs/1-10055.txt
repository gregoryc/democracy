Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
