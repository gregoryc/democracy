Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
