Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
