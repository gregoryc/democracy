Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
