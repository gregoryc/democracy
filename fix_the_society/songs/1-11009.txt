Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
