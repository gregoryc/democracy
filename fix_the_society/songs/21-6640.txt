Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
