Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
