Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
