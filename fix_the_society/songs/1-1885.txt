Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The state of science is, wholly inert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The state of science is, wholly inert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
