Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
