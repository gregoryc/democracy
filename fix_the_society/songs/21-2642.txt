Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
