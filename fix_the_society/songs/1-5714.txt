VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
