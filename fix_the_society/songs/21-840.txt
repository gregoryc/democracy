Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
