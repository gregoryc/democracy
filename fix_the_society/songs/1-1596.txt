Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
