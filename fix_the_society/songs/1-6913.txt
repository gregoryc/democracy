Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
