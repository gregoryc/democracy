Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
