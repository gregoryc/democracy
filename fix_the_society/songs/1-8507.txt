Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
