Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
