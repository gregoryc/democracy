Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
