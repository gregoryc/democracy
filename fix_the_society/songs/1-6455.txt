Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
