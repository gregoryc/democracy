Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
