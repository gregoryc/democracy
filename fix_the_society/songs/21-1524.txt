Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS
