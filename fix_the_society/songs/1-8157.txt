Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert
