Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
