Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
