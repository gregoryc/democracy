Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
