Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Don't have to do with ego or id

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
