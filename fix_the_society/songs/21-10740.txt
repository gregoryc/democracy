Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
