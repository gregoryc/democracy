Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
