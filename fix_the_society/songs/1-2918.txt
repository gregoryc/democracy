Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
