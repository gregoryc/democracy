Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
