Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Evading conversation just like a kid

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
