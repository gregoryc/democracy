Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
