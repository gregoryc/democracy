Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
