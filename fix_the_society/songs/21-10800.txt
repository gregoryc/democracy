Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
