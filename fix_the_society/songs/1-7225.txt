Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
