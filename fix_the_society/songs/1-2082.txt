VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
