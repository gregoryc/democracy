Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
