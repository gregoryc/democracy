Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
