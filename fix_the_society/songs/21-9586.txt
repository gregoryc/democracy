Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
