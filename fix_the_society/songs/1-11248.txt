Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
