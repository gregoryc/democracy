Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
