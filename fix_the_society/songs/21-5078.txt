Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
