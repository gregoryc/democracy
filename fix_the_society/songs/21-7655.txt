Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
