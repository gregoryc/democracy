Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
