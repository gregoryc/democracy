Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
