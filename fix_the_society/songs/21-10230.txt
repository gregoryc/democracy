Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
