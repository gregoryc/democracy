Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
