Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
