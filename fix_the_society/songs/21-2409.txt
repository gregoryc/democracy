Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
