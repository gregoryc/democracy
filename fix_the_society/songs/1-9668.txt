Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
An open conversation, they always divert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
