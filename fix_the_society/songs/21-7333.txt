Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
