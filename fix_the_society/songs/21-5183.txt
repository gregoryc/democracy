Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
