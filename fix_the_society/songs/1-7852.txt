Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
