Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
