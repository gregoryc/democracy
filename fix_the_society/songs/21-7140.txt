Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
