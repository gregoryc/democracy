Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
