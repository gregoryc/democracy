Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
