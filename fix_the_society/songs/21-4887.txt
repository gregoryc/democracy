Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
