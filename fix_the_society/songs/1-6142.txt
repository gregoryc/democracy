Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
