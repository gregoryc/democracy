Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
