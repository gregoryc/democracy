Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
