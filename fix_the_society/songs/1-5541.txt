Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
