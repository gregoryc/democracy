Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
