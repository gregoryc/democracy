Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Running away from conversation just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Running away from conversation just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Running away from conversation just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
