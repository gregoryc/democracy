Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
