Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
