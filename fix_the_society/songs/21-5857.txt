Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
