Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
