Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
