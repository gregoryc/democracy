Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
