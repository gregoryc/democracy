Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
