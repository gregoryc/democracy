VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
