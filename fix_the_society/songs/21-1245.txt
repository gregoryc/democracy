Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
