Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
