Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
