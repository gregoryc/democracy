Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
