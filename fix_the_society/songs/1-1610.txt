Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
