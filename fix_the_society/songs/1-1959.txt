Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
I must speak here, I must interject

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
I must speak here, I must interject

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
I must speak here, I must interject

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
I must speak here, I must interject

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
