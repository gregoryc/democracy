Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
