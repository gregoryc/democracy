Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
