Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
