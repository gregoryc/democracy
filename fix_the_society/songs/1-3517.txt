Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You make broad claims while acting like a kid

The society itself, they completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Evading conversation just like a kid

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
