Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
