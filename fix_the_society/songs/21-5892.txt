Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
