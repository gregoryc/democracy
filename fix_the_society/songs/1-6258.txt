Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
