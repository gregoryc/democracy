Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
