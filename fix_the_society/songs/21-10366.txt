Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
