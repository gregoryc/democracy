Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
