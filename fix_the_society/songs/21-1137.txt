Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
