Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
