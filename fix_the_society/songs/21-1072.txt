Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
