VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
