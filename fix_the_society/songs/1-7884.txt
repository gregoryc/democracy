Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
