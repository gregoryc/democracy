Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
