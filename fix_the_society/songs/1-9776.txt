Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
