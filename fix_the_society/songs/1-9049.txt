Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

The state of science is, wholly inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
