Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
