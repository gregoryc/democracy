Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
