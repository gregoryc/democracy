Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They do junk, they do dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
