Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
