Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
