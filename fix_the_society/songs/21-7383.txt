Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
