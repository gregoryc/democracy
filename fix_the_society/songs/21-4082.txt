Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
