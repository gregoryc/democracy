Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
