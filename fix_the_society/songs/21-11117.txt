Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
