VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
