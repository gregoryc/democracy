Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
