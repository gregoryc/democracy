Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
