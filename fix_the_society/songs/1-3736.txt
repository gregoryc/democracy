Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
