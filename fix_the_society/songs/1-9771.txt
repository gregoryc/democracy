Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The state of science is, wholly inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
