VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Science is  fundamentally inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Science is  fundamentally inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Science is  fundamentally inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
