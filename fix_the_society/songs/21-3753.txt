Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
