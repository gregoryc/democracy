Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
