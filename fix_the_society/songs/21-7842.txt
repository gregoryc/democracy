Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
