Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
