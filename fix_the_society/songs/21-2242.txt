Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
