Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
