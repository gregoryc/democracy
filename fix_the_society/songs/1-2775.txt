Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
