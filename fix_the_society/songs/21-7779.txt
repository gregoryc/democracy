Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
