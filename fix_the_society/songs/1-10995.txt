Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Not talking isn't going to divert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Not talking isn't going to divert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
