Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
