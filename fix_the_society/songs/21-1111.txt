Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
