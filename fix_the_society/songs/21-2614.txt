Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
