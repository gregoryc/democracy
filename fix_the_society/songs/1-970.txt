Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
