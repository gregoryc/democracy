Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
