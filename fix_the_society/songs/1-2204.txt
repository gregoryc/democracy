Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
