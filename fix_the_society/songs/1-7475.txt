Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
