Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
