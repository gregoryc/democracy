Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
