Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred

The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
