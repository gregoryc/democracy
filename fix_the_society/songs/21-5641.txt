Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
