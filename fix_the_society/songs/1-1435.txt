Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
