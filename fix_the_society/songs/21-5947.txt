Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
