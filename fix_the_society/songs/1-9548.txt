Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
