Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
