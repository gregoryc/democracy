Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

I must speak here, I must interject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, you act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
