Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
