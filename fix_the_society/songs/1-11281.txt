Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
No one will be unhurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
