Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
