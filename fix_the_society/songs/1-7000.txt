Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
