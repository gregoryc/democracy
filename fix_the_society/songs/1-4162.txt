Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
