Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
