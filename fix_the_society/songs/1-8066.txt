Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
