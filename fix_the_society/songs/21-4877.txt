Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
