Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
