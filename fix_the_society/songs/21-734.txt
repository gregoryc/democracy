Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
