Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
