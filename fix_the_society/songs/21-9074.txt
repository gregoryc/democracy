Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
