Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
