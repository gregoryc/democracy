VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The state of science is, wholly inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
