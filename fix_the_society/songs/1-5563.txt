Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
