Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They do junk, they do dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
