Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

VERSE

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
