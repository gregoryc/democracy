Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
