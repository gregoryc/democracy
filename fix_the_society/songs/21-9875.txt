Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
