Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
