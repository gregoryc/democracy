Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
