Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
