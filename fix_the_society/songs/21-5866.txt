Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
