Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
