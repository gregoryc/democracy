Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't think, they act like a kid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
