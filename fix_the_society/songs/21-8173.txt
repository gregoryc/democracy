Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
