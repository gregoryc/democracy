Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
