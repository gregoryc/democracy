Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

CHORUS

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They do junk, they do dirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, they act like a kid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
