Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
