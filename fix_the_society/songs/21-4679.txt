Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
