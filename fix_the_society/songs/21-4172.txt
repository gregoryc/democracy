Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
