Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
