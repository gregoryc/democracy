Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
