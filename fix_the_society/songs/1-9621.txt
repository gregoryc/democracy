Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
