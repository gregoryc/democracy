Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
