Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
