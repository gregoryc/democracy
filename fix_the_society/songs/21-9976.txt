Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
