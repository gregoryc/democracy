Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
