Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
