Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
