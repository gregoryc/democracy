Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
