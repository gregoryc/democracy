Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
