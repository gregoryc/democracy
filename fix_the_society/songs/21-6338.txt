Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
