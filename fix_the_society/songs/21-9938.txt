Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
