Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
