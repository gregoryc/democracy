Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
