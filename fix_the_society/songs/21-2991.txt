Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
