Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
