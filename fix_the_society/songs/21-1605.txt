Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
