Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
