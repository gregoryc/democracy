Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
