Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is too insidious for many to detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
