Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
