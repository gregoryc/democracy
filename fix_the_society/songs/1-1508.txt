Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
