Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
