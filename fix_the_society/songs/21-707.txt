Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
