Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Playing only the worst card

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
