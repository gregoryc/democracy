Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
