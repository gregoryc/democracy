Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
