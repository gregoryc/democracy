Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
