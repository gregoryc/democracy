Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
