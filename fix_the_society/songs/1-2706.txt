VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Evading conversation just like a kid

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
