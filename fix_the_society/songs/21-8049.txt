Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
