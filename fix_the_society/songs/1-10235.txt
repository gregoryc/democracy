Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
