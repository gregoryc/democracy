Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
