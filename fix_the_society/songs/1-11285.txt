Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
