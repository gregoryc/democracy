Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
