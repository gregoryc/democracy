Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
