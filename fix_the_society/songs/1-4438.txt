Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
