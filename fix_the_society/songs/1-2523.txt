Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
