Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
