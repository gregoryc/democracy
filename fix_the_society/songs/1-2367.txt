Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Evading conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
