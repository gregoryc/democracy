Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too insidious for many to detect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too insidious for many to detect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too insidious for many to detect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
