Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
