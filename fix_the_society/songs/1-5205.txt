Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, you act like a kid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
