Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
