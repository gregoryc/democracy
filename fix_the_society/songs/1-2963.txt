Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
