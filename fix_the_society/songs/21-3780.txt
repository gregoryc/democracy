Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
