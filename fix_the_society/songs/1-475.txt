Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
