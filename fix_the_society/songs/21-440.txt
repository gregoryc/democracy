Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
