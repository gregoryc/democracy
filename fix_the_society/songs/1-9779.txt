Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

VERSE

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
