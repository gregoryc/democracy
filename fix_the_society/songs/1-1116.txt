Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
