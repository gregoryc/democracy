Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
