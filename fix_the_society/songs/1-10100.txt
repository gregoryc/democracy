Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
