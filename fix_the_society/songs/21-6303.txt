Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
