Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
I must speak here, I must interject

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They do junk, they do dirt
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
