Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
