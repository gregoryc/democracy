Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

To human ideals, you don't want to connect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
