Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
