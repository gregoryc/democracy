Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
