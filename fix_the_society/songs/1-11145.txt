Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Evading conversation just like a kid

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
