Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
