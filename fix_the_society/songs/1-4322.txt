Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
