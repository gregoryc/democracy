VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
