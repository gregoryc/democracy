Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
