Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
