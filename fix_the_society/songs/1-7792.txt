Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

You make broad claims while looking like a kid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
