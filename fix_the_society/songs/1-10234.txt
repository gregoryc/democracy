Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
