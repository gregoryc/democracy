Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
I must speak here, I must interject

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
