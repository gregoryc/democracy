Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
