Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
