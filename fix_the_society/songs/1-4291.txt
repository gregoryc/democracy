Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
