Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
