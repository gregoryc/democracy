Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
