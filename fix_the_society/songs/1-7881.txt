Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
