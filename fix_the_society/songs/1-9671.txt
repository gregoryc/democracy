Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
