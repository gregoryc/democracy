Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
