Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
No one will be unhurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
