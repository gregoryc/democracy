Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
