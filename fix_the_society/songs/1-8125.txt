Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
