Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

VERSE

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
