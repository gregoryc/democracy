Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
