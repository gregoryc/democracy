Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
