Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
