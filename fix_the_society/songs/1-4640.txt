Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
