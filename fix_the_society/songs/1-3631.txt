Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
