Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
