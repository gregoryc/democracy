Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
