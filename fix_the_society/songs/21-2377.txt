Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
