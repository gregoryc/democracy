Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
