Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
