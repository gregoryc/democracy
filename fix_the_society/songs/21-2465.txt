Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
