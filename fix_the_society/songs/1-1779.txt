Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
