Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
