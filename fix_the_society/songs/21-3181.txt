Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
