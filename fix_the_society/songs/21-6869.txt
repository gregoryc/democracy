Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
