Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
