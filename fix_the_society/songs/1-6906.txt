Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
