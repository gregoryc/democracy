Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
