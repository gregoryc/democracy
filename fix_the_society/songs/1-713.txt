Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
