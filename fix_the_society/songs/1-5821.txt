Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
