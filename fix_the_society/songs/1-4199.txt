VERSE

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
