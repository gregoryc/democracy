VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They do junk, they do dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
