Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
