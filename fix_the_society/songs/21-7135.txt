Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
