Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is too insidious for many to detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
