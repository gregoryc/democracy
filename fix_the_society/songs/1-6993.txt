Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
