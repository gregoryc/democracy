VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
