Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
