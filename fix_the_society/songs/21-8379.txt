Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
