Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
