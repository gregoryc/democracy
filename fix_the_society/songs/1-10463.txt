Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
