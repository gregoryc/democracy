Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
