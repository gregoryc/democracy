Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Science is  fundamentally inert

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
