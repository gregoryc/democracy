Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
