Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
