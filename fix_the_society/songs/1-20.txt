Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
