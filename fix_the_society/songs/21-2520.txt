Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
