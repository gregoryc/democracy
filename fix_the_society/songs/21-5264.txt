Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
