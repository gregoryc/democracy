Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
