Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
