Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
