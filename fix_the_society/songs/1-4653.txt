Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
