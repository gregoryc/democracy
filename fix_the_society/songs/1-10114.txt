Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Science is  fundamentally inert

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Science is  fundamentally inert

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Science is  fundamentally inert

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
