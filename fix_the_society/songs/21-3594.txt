Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
