Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
