Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
