Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
