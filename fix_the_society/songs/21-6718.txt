Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
