Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
