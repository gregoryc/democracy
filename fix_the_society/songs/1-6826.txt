Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't think, you act like a kid

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
