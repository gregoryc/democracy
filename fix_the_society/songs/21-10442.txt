Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
