Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
