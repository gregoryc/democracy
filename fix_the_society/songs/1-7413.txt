Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
