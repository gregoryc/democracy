Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
