VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
