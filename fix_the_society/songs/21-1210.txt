Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
