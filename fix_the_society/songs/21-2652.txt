Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
