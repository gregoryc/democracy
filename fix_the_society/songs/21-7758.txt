Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
