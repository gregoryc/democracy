Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
