Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
