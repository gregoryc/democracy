Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
