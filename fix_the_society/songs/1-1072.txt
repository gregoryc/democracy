Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
