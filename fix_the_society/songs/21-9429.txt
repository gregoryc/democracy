Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
