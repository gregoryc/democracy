Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
