Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
