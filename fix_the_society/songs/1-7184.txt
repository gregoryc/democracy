Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too insidious for many to detect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
