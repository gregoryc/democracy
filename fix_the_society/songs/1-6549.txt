Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
