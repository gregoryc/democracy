VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
