Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
