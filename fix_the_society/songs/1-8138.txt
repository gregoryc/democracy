Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
