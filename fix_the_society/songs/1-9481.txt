Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
