Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel idea, they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
I must speak here, I must interject

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
