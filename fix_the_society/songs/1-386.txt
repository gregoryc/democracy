Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
The society is the ones who hurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
