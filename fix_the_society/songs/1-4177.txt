Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
