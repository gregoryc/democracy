Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
