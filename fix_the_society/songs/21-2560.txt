Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
