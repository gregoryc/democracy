Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
