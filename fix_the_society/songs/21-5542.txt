Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
