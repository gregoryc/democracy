Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
