Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
