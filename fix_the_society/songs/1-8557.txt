Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
