VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
