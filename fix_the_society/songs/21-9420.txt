Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
