Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
