Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and moaning like a kid

Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
