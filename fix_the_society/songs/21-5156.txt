Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
