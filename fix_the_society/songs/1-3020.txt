Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
