Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
