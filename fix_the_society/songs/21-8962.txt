Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
