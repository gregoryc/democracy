Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
