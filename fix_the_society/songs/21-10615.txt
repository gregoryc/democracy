Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
