Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
