Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Reason is what they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The state of science is, wholly inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Reason is what they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their own principles are something they do not respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
