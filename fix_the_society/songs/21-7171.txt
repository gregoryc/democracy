Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
