Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
I must speak here, I must interject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
I must speak here, I must interject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
I must speak here, I must interject

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
