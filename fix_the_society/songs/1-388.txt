Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
