Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
