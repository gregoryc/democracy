Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You make broad claims while looking like a kid

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
