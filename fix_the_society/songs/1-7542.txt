Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
