Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
