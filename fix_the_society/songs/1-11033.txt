Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad claims while acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
