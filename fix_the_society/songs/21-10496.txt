Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
