Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
