Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
