Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
