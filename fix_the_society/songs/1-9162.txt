Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
