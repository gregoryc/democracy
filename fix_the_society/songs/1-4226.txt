Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
