Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
