Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
