Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
