Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
