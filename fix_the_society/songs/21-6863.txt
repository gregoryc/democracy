Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
