Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
