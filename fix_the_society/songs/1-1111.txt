Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

VERSE

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
