Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
