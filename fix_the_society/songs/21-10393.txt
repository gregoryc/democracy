Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
