Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
