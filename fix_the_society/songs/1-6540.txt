Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
