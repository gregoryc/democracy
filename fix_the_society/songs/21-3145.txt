Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
