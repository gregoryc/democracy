Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
