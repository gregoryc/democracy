Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
