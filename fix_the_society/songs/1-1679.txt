Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
