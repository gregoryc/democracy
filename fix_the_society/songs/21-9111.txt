Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
