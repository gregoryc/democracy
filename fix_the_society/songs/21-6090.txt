Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
