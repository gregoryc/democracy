Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
