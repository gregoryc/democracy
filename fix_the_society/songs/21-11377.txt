Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
