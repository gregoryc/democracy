Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
