Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
An open conversation, they always divert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
