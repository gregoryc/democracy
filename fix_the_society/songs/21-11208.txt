Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
