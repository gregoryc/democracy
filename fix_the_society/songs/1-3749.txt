Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
