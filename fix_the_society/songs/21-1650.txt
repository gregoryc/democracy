Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
