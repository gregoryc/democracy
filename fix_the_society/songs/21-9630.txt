Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
