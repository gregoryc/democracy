VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
