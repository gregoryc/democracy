Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
