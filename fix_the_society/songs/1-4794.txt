Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
