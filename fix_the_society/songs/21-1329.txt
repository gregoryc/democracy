Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
