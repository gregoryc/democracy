Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
