Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
