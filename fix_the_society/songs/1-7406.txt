Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't think, they act like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
