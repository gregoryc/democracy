Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They do junk, they do dirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They do junk, they do dirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
