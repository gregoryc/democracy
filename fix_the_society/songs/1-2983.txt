Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
