Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
