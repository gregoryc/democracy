Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
