Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
