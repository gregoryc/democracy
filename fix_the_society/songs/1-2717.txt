Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
