Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
