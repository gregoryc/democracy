Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too insidious for many to detect

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
