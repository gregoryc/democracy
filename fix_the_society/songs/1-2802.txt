Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
