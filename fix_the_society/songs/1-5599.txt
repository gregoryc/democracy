Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
