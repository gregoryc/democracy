Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
