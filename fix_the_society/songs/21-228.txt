Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
