Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
