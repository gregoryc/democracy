Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
