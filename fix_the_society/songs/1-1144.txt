Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
