Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
