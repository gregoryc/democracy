VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
