Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
