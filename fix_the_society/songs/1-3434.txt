Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

An open conversation, they always divert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The state of science is, wholly inert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Science is  fundamentally inert
The society is the ones who hurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The state of science is, wholly inert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
