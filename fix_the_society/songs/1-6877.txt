Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, they completely neglect

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
