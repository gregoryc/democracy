Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
