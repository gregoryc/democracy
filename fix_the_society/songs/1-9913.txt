Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
