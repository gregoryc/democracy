Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
