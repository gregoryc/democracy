Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
