VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
