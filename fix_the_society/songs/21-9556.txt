Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
