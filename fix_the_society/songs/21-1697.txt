Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
