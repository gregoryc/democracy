Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
