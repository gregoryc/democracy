Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
