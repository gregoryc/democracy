Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Away from the truth they hid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Away from the truth they hid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
