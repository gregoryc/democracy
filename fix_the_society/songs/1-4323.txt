Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
