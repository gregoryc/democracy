Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
I must speak here, I must interject

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
