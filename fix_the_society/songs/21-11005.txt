Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
