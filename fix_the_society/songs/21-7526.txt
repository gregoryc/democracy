Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
