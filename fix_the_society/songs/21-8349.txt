Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
