Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
