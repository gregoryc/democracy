VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Whining and moaning like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
