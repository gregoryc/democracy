VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
