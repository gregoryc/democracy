Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
