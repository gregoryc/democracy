Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too insidious for many to detect

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
