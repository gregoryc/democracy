Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
