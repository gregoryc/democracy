Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
