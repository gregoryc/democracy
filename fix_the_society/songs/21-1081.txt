Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
