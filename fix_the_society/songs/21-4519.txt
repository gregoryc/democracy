Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
