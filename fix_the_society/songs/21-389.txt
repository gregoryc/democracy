Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
