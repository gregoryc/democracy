Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
