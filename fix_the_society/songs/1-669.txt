Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

CHORUS

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
