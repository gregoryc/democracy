Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
