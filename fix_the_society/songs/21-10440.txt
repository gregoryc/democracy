Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
