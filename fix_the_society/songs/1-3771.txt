Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
