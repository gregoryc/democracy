Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
