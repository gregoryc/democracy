Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
