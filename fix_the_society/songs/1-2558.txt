Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
I must speak here, I must interject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
