Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They don't think, you act like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
