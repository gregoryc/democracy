Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
