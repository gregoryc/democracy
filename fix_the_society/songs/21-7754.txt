Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
