Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
