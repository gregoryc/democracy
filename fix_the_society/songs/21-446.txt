Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
