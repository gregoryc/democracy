VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
