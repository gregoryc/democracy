Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
