Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
