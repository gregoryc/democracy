Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
