Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
