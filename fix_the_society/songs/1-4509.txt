Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
