Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
