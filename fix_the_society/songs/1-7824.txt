Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
