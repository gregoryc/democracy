VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
