Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject

Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
