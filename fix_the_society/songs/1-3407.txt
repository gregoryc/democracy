Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
