Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
