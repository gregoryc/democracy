Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
I must speak here, I must interject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
