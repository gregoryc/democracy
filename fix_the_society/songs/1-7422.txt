Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
An open conversation, they always divert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
