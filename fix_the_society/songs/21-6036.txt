Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
