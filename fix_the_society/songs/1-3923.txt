VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
