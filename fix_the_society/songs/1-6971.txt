Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
