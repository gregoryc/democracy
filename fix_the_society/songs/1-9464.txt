Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
