Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
