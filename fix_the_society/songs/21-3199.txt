Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
