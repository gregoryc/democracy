Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
