Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
