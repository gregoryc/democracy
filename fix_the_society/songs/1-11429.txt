Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
