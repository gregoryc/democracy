Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
