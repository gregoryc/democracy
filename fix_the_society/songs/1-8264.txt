Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
