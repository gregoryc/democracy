Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
If you talk to them they miss the subject

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
