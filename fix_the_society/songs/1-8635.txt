Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
