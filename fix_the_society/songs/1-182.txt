Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
