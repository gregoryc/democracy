Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
