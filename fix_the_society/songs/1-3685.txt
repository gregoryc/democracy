Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
I must speak here, I must interject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
