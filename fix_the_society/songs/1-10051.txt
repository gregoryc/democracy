Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
