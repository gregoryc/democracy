VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
