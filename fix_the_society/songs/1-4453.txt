Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is plain, anyone can detect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
I must speak here, I must interject

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is plain, anyone can detect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is plain, anyone can detect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is plain, anyone can detect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
