VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert

An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
An open conversation, they always divert

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
