Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
