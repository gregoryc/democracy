Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
