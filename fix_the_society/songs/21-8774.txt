Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
