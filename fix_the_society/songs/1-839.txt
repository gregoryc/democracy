Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
