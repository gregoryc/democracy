Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They do junk, they do dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They do junk, they do dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
