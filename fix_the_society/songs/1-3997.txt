Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
