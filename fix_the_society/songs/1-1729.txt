Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
