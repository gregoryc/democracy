Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
