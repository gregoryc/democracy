Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The state of science is, wholly inert

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
