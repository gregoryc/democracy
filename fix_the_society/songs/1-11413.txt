Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
