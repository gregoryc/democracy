Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
