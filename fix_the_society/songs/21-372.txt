Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
