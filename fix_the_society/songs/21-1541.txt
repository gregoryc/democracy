Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
