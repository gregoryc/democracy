Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
