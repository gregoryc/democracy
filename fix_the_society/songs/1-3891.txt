Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Their behavior makes them charred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
