Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
