Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
