Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and crying like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
