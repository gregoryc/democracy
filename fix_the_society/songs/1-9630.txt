Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
