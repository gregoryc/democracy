Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
