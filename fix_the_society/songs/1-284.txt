Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
