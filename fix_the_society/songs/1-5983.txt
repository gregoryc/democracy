Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
