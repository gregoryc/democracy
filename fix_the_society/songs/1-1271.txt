VERSE

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
