Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
