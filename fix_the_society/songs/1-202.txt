Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
