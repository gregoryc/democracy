Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
