Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
