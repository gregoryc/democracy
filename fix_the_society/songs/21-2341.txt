Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
