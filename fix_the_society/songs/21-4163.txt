Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
