Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
