Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
