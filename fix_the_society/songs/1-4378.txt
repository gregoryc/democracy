Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
