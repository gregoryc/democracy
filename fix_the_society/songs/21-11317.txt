Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
