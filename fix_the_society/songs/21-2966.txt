Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
