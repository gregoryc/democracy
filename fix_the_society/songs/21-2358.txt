Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
