Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
