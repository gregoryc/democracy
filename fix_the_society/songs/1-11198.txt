Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
