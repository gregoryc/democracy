Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
