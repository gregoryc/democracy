Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
