Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
