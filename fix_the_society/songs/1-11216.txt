Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

VERSE

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
