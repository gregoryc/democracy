Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, you act like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
