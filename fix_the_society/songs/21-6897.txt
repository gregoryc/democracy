Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
