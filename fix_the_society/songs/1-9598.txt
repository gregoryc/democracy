Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
