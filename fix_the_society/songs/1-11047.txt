Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

The state of science is, wholly inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The state of science is, wholly inert

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

The state of science is, wholly inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

The state of science is, wholly inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
