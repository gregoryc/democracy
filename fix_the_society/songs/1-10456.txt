Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
