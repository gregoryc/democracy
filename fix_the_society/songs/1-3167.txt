Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They do junk, they do dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

I must speak here, I must interject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
