Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
