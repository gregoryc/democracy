VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
