Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
