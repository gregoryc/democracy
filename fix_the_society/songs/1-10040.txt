Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
