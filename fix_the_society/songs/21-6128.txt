Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
