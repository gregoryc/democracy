Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
