VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Science is  fundamentally inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
