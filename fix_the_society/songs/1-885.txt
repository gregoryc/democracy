Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
