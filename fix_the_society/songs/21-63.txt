Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
