VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect
