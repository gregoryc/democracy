Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
