Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They can't alter anything, they are inert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
