Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Protesting your problems will make you best

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Protesting your problems will make you best
