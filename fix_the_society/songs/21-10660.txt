Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
