Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
