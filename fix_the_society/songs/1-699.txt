Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Science is  fundamentally inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
