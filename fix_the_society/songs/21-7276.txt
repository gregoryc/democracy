Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
