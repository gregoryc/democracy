Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
