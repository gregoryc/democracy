Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

I must speak here, I must interject
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

I must speak here, I must interject
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
