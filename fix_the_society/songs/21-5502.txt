Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
