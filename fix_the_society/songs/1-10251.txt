Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
