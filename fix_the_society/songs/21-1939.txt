Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
