Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
