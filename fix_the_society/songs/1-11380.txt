Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They do junk, they do dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
