Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
