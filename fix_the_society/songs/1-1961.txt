Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
