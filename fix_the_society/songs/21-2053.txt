Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
