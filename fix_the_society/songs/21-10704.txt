Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
