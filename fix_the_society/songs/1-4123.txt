Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
