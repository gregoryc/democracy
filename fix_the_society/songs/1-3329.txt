Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
