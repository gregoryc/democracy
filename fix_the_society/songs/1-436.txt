Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
