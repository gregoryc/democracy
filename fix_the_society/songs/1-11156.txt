Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
