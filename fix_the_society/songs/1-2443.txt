Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
