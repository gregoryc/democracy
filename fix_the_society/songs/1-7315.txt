Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
