Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
