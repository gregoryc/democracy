Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
