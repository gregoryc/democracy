Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
