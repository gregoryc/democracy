Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
