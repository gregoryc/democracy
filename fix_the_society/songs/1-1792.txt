Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Running away from conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Running away from conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
