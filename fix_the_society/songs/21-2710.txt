Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
