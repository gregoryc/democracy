Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
