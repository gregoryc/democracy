Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
