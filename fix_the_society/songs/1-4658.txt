Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
