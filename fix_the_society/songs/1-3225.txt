VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
