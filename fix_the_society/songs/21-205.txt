Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
