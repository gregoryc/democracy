Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
