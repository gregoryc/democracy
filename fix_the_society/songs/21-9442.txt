Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
