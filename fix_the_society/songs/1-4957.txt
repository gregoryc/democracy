Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
