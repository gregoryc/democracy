Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
