Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
I must speak here, I must interject

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
I must speak here, I must interject

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
If you talk to them they miss the subject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
