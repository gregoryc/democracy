Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
