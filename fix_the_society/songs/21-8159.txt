Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
