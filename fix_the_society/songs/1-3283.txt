VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
