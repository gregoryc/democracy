Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
