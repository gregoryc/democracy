Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
