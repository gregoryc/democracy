Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
