Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
