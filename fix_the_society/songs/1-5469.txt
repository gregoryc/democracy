Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

If you talk to them they miss the subject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
