Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
I must speak here, I must interject

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
