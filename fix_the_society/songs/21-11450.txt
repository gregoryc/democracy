Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
