Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
