Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
