VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
