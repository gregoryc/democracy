Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
