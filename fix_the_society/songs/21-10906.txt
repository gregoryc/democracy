Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
