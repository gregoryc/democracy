Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
