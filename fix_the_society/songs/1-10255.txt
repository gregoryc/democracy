VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
