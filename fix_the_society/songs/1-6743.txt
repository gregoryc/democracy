Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
