VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
