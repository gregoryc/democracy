Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
