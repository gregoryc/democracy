VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
