Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
