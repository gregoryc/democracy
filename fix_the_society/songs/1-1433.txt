Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
