VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
