Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
