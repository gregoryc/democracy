Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
