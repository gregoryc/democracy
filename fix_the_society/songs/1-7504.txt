Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, you act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
