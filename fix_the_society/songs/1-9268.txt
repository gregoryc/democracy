VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
I must speak here, I must interject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
