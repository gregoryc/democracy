Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
