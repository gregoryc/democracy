Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
