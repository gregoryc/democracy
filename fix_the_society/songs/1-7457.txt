VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
