Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
