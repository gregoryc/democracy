Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
