Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
