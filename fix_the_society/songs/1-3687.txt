VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
