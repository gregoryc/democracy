Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
