Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
