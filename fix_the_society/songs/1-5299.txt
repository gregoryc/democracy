Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
