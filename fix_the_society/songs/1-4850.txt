Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They make broad claims while looking like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
