Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
