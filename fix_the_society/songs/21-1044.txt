Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
