VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
