Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
