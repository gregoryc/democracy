Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
