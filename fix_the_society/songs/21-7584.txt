Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
