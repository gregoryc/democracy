Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
