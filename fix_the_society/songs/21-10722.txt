Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
