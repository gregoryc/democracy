Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
