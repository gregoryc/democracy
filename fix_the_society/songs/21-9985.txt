Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
