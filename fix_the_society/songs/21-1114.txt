Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
