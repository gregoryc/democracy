Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
