Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
