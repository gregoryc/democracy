Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
