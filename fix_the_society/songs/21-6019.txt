Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
