VERSE

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
