Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
