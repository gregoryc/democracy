Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
