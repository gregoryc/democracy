Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
