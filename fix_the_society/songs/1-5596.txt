Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
I must speak here, I must interject
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
