Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
