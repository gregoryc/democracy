Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
