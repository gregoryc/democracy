Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
