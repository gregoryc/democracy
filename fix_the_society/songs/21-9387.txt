Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
