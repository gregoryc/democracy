Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
