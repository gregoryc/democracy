Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
