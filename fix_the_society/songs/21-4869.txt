Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
