Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Any novel idea, they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
They don't think, you act like a kid

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
