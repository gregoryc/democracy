VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
