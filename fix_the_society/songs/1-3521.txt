Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
