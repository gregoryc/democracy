VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
