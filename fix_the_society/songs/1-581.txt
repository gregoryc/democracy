Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
