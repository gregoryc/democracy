Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
