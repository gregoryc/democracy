Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
