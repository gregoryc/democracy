Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
