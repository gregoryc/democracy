Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
