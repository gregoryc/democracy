Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
