Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
