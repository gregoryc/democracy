Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
