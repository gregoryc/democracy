Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
