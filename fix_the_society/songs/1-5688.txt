Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Science is  fundamentally inert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
