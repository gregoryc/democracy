Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
