Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Evading conversation just like a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
