Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
