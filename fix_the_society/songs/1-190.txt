Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

CHORUS

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
