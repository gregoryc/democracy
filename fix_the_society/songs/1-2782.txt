Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't think, you act like a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't think, you act like a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, they completely neglect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and crying like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
