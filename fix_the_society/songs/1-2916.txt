Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
