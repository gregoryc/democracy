Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
