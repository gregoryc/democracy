Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
