Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
