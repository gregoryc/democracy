Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
