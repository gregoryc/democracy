Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They do junk, they do dirt
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Running away from conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
