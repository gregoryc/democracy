Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
