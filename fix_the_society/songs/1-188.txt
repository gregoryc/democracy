Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

I must speak here, I must interject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

I must speak here, I must interject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
