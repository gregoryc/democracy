Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
