Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
