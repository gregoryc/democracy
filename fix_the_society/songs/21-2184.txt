Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
