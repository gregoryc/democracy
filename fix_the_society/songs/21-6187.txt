Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
