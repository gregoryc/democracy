Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
