Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
