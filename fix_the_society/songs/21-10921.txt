Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
