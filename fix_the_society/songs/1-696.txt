Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
