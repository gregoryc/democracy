Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
