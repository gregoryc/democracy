Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
