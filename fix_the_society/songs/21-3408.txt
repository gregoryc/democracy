Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
