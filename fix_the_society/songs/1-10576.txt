Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
