VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
