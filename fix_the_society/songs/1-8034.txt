Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
