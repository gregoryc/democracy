Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
