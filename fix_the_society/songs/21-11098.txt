Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
