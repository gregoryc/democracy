Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
