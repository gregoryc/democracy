Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
