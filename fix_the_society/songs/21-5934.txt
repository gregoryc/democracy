Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
