Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
