Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
