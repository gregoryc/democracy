Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
