Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
