Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
