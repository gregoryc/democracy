Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
