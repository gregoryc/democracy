VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
