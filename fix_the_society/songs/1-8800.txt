Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

I must speak here, I must interject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
