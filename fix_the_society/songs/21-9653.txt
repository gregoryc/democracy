Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
