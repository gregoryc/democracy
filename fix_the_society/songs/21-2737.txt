Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
