VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
