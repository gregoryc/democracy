Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
