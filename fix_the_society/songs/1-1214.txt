Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
