Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
