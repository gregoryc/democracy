Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
