Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
