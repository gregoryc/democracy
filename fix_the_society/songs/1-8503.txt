Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
