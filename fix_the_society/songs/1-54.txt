VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
