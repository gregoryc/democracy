Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
