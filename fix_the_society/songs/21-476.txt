Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
