VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
