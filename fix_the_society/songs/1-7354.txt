Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
