Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

CHORUS

The state of science is, wholly inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
