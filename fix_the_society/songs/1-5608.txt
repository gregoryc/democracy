Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
