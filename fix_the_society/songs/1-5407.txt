Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
