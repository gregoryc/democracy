Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
