Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
