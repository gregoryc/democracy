VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
