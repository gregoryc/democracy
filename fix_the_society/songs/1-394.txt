Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

Reason is what they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

Reason is what they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
