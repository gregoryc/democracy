Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
