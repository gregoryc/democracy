Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
