Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
