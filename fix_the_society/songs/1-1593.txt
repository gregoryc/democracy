VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
