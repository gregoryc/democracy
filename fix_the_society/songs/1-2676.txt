Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They can't alter anything, they are inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid

They hate themselves, they do not respect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
