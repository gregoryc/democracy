Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
