Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
