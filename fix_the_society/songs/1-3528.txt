Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
