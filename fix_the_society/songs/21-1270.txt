Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
