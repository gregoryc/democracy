Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
