Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
