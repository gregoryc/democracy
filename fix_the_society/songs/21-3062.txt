Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
