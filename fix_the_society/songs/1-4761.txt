Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
