Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, you completely neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
