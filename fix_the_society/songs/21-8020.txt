Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
