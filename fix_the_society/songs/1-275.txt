Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
