Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
