Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Evading conversation just like a kid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Evading conversation just like a kid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Evading conversation just like a kid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
