VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
