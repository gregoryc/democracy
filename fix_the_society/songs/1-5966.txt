Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novelty, they have disregarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
