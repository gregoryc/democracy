Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
I must speak here, I must interject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
