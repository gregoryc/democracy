Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
No one will be unhurt

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is too insidious for many to detect
