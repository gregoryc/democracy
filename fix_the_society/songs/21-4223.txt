Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
