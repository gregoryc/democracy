Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
