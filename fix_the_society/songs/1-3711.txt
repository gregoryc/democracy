Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
