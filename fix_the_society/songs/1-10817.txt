Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
