Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
