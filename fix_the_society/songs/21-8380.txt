Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
