Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
