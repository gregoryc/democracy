Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
