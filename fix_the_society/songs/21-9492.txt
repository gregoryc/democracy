Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
