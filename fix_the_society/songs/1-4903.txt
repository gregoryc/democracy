VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
