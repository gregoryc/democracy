Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
