Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
