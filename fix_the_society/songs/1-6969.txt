Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't think, you act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
