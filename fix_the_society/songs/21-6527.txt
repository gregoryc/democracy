Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
