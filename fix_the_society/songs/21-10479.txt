Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
