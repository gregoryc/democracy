Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
