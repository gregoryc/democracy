Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They hate themselves, they do not respect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
