Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
