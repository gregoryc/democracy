Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
