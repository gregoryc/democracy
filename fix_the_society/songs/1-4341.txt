Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
