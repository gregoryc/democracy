Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

No one will be unhurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
