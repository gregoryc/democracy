Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You make broad claims while acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, they act like a kid

CHORUS

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

This is plain, anyone can detect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
