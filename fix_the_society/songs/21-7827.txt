Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
