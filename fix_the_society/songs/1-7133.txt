Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
