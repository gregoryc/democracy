Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
