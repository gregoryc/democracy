Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
