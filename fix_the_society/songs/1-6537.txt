Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
