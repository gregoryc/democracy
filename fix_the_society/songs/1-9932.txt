Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
