Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
