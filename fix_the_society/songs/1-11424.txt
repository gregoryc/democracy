VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
