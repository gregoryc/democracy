Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
