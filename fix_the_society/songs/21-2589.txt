Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
