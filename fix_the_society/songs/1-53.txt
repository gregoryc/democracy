Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
