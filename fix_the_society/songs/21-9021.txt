Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
