Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
