Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
