Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
