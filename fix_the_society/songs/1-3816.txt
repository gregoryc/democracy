Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
