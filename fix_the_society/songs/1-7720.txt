Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't think, you act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
