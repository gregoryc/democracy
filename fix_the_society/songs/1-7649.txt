Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
