Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
