Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You make broad claims while acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
