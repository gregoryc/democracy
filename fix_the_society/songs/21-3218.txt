Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
