Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
