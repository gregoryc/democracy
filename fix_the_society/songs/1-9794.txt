Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Science is  fundamentally inert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
