Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
