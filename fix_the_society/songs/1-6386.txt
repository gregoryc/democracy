Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
