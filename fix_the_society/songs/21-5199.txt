Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
