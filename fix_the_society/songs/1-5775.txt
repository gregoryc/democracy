Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
