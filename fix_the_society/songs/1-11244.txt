Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
