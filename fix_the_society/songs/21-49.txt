Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
