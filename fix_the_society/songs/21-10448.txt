Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
