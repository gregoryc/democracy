Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
I must speak here, I must interject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
