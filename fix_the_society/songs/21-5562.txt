Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
