Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
