Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
