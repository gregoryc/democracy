Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
