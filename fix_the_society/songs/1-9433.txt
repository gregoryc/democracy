Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
