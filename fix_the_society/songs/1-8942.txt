Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
