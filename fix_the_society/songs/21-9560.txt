Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
