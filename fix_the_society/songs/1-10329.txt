Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
