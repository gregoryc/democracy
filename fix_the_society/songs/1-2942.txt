VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and complaining like a kid

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
