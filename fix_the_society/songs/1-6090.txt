Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is plain, anyone can detect

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and complaining like a kid

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
