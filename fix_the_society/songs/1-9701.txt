Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
