Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
