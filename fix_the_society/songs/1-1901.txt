Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
