Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
