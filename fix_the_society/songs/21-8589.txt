Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
