Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
