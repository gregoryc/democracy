VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
