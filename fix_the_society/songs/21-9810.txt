Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
