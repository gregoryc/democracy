Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
