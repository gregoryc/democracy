Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
