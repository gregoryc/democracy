Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
