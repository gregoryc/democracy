Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
