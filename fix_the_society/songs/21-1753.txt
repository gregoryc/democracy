Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
