Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
