Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
