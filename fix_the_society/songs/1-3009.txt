VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
