Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Stop this already, time to get rid

Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, you act like a kid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
