Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid

An open conversation, they always divert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
