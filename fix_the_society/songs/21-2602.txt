Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
