Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
