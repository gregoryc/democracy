VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
