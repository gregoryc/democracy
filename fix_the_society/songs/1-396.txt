Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
