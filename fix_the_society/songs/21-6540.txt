Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
