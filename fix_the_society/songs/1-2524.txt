Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
