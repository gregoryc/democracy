Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
