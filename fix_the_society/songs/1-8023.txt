Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
