Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
