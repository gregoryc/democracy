Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
