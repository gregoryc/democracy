Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
