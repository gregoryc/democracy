Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
