Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They do junk, they do dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Reason is what they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

This is too insidious for many to detect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
