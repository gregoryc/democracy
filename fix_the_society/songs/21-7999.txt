Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
