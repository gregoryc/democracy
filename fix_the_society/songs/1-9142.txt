Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and crying like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
