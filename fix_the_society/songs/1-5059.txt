Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
