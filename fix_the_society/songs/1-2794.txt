Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
