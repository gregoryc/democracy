Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
