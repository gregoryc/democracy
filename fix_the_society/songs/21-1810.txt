Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
