Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
