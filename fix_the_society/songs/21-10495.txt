Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
