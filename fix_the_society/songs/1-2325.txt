Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This is plain, anyone can detect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
