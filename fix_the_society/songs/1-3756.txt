Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
