Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
