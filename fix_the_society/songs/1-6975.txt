Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
