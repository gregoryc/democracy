Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to communicate, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
