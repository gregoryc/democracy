Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
