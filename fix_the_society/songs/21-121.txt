Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
