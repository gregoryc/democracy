Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
