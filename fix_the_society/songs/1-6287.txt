Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
