Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
