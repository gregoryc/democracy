Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
