Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
