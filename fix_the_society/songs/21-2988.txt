Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
