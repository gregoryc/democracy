Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They don't think, you act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
