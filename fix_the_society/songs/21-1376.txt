Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
