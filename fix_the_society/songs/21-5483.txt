Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
