Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
