Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
