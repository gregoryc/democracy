Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
