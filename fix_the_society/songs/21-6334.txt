Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
