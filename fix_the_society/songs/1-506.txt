Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
