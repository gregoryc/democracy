Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
I must speak here, I must interject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
I must speak here, I must interject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
I must speak here, I must interject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
I must speak here, I must interject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
