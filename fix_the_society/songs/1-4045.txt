Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
