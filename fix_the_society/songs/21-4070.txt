Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
