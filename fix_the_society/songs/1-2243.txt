Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
