Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
