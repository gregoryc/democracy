Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
