Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
