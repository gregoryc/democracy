Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
