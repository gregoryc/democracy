Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
