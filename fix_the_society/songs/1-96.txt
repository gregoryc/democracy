Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
