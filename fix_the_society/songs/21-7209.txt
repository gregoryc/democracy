Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
