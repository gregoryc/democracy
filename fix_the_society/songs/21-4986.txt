Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
