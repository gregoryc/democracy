Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
