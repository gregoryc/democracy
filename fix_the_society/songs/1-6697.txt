Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
