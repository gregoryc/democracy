Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Their own principles are something they do not respect

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
