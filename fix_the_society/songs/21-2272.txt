Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
