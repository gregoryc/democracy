Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
