Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
