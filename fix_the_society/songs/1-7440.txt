Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
