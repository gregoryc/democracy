Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
