Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
