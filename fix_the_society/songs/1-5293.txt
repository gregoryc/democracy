Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
