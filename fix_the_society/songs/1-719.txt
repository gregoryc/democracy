Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
