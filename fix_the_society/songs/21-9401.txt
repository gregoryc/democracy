Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
