Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
