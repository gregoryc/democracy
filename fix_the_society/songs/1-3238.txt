Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
