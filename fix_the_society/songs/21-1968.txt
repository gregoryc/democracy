Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
