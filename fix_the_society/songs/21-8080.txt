Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
