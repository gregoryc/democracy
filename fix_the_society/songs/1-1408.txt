Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
