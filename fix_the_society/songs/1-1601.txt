VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
