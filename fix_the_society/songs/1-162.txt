Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is plain, anyone can detect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
