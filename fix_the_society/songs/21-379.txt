Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
