Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
