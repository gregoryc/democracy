Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They do junk, they do dirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
