Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
