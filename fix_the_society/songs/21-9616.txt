Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
