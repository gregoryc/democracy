Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
