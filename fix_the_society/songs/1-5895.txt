Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
