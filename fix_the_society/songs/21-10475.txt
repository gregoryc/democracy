Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
