Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
I must speak here, I must interject

Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
