Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
