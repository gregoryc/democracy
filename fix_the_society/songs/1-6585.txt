Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and moaning like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

CHORUS

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
