Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Whining and moaning like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
