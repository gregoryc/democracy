Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They make broad claims while acting like a kid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They make broad claims while acting like a kid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
