Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
