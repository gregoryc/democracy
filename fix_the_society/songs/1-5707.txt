Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is plain, anyone can detect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
