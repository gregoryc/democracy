Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't think, they act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
