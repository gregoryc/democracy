Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
