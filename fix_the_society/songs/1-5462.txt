Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
