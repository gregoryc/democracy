VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
