Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
