Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
