Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
