Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
