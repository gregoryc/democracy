Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
