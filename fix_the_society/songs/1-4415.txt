Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
