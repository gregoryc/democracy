Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
