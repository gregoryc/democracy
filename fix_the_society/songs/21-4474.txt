Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
