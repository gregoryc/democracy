Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
