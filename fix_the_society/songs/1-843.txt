Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
