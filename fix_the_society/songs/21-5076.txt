Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
