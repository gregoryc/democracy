Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
I must speak here, I must interject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
