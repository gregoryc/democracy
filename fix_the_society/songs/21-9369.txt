Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
