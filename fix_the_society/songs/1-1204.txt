Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
