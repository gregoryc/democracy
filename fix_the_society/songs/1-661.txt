Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
