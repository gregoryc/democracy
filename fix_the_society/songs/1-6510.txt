Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
