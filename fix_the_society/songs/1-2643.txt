Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
