Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Destruction and doom is what they architect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't think, you act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
