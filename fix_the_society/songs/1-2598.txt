Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
