Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
