Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
