Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
