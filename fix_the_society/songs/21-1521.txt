Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
