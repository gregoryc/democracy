Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
