Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
