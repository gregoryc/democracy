Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
