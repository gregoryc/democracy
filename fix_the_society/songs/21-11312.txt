Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
