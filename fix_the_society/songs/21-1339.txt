Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
