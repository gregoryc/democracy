Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
