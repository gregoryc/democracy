Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
