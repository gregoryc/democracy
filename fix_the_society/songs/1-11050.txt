Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
