Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
