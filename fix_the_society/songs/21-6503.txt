Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
