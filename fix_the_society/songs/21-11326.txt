Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
