Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
