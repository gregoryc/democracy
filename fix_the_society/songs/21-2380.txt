Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
