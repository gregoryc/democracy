Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
