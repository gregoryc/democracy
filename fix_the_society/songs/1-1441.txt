Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
