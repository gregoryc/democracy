Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
