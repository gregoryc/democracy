Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

CHORUS

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
I must speak here, I must interject

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
