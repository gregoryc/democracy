Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
