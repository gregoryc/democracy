Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
