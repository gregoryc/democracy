Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
