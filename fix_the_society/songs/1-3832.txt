Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
