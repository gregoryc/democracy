Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
