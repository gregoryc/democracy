Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
