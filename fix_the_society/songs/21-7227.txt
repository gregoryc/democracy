Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
