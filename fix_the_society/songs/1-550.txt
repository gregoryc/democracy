Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
