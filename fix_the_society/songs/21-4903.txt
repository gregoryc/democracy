Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
