Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
