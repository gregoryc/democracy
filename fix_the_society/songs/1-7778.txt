Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
