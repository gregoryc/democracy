Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
