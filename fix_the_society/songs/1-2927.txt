Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
