Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
