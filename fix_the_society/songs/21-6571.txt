Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
