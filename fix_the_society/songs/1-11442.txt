Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
