Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Reason is what they want to discard
