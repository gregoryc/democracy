Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
