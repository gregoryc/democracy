VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
