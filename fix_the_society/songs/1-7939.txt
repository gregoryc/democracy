Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
