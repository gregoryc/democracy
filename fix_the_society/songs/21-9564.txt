Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
