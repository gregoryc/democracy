Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
