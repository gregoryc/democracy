Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
