VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
