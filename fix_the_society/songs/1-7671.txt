Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
