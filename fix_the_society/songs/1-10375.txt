Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
