Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
