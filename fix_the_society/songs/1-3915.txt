Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The state of science is, wholly inert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is too insidious for many to detect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
