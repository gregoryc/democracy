Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
