Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
