Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
