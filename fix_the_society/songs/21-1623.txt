Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
