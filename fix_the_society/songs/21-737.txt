Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
