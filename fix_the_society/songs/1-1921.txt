VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
