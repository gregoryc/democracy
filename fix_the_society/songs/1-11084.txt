Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
