Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
