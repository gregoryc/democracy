Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, they completely neglect

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
