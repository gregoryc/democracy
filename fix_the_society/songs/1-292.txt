VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and moaning like a kid

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
