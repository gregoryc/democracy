Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Science is  fundamentally inert
