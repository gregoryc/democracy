Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
