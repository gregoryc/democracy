Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
