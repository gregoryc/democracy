Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
