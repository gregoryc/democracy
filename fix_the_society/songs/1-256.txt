Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
