Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
