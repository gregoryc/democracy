Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
