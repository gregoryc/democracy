Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
