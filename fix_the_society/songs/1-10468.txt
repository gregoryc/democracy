Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
