Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
