Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
