Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
