Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
