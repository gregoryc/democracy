Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
