Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
