Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The state of science is, wholly inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
