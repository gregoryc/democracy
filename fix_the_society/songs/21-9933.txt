Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
