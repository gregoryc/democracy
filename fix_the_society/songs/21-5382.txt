Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
