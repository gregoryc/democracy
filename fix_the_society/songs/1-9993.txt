Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
