Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
