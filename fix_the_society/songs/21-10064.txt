Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
