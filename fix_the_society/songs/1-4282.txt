Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

You make broad claims while looking like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
