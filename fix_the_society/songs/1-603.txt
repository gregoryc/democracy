Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
