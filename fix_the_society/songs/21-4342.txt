Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
