Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

If you talk to them they miss the subject
I must speak here, I must interject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
