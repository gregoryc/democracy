Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
