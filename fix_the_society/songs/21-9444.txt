Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
