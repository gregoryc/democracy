Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
