Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
