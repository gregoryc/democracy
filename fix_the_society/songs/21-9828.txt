Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
