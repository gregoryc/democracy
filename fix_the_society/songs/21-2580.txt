Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
