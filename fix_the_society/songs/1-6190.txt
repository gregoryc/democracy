Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Reason is what they want to discard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
