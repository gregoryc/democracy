Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
