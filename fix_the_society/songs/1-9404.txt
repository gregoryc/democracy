Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
