Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
