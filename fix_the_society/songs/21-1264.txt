Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
