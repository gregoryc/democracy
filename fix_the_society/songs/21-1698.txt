Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
