Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
