VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
