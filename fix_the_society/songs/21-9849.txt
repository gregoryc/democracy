Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
