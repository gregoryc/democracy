Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
