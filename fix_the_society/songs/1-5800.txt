Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Science is  fundamentally inert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
