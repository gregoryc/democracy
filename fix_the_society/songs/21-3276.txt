Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
