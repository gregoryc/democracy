Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
