Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
