Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
