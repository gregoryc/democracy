Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
