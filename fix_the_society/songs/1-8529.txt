Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
