Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
