Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
