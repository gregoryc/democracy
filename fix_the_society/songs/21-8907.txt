Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
