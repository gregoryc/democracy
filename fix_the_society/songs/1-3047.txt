Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid
