Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
