Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
I must speak here, I must interject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
