Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
