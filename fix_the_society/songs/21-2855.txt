Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
