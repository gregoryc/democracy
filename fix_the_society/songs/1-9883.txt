Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Science is  fundamentally inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
