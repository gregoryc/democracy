Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
