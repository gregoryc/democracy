Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
