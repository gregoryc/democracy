VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
