Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
