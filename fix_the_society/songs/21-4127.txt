Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
