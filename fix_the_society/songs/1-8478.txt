Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society is the ones who hurt
They do junk, they do dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
