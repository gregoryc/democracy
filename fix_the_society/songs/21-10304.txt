Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
