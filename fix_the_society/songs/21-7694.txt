Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
