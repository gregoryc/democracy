Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
