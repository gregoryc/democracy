Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
