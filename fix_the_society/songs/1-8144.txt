Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

I must speak here, I must interject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
