VERSE

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
I must speak here, I must interject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
I must speak here, I must interject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
