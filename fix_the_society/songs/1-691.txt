Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Evading conversation just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

An open conversation, they always divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
