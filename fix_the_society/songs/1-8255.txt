Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
The state of science is, wholly inert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
