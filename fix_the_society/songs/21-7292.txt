Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
