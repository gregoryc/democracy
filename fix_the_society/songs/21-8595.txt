Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
