Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
