Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
