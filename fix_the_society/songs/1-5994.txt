Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Running away from conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

CHORUS

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
