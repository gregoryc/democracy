Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
