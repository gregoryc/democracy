Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
