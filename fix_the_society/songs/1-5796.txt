Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
