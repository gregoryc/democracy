Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is plain, anyone can detect
The society itself, they completely neglect
