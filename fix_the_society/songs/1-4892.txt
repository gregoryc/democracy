Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
