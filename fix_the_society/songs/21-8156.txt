Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
