Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
