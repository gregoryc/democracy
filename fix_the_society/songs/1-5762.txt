Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
