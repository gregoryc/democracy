Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
