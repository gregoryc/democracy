Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
