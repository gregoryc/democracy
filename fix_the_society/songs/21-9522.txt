Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
