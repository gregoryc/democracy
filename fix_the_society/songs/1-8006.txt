Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They do junk, they do dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
