Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
