Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
