Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
