Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
