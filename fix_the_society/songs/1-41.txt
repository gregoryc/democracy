Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
