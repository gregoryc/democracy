Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
