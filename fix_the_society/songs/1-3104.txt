Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
