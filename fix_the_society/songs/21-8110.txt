Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
