Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
