Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
