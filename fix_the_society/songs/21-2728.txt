Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
