Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
