Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is plain, anyone can detect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They do junk, they do dirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
