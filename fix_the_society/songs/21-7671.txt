Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
