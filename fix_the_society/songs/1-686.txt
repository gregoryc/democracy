Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
