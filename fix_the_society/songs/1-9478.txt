Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
