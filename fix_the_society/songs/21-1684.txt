Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
