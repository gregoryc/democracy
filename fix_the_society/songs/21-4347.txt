Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
