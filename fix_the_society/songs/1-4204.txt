Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
