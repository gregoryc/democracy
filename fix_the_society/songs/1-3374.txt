Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
