Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
