Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and complaining like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
