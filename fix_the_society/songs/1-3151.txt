Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
I must speak here, I must interject

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
I must speak here, I must interject

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
