Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
