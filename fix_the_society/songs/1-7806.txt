Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
