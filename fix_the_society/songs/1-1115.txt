Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
