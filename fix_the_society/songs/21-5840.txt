Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
