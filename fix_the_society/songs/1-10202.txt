Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, you act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
