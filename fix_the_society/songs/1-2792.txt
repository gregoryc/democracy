Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't think, you act like a kid

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, you act like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

This is wholesale, in every aspect
I must speak here, I must interject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
