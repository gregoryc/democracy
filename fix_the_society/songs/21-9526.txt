Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
