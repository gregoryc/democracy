Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
