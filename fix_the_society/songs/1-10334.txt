Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
