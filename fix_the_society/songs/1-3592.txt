Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
