Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The state of science is, wholly inert

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
I must speak here, I must interject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The state of science is, wholly inert

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The state of science is, wholly inert

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
