Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
