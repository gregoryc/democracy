Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
