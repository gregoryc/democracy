Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and crying like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
