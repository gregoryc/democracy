Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
