Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
