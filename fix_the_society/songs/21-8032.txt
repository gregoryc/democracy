Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
