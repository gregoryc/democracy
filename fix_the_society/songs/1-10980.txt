Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
