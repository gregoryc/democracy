Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
