Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
