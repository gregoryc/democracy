Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They do junk, they do dirt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
