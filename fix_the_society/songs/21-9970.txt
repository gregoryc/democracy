Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
