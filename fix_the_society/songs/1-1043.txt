Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
