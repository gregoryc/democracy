Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
