Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
