Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
