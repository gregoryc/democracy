Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
