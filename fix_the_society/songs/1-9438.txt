Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
