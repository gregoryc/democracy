Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
