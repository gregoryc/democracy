Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
