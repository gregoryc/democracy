Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
