Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect

The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
