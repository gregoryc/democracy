Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
