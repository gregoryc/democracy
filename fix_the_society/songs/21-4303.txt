Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
