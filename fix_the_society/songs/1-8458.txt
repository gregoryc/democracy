Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
