Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
