VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Science is  fundamentally inert

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior makes them charred

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
