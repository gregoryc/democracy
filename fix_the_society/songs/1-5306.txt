Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
