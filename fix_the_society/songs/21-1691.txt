Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
