Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
