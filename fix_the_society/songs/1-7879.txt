Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
