Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
