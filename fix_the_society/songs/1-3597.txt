Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
