Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
