Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
