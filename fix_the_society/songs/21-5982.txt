Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
