Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
