Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
