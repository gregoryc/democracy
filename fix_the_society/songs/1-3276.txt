Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, they act like a kid

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

The society is the ones who hurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
