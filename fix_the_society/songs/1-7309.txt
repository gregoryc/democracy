Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
