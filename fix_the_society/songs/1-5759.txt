Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
