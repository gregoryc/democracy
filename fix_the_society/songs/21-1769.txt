Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
