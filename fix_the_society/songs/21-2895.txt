Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
