Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
