Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
