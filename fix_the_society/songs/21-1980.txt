Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
