Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
