Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
