Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
