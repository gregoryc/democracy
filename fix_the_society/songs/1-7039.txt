Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
I must speak here, I must interject

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
