Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
