Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
