Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
