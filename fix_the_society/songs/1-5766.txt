Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The state of science is, wholly inert
No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
