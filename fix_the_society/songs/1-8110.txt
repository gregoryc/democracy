Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
I must speak here, I must interject

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
I must speak here, I must interject

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
