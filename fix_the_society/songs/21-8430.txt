Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
