Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
