Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
