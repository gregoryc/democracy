Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
