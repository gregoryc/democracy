Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
