Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
