Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
