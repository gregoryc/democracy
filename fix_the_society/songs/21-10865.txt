Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
