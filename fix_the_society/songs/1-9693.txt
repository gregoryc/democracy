Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
