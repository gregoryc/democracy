Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
