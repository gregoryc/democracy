Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
