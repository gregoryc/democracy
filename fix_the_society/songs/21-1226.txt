Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
