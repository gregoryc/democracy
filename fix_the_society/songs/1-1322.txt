Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is obvious, anyone can detect
