Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
