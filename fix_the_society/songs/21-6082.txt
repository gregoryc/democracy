Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
