Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
