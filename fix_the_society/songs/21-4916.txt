Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
