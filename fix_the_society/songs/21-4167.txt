Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
