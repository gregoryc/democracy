Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
