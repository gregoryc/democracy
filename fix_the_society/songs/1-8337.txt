Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
