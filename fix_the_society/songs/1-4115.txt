Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
