Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
I must speak here, I must interject

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
