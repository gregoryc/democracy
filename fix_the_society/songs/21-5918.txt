Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
