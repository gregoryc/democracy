Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
