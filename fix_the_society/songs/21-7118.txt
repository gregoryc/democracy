Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
