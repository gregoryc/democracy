Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
