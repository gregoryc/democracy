Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
