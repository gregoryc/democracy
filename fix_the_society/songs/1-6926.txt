Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
