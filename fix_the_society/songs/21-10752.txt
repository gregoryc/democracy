Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
