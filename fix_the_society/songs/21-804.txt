Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
