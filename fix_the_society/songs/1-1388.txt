Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
