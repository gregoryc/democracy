Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

They can't alter anything, they are inert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
