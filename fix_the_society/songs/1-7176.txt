Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and complaining like a kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
