VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, you act like a kid

The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
