Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
