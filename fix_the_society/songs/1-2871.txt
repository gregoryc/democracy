Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, they completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
