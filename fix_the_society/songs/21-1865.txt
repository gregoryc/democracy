Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
