Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
