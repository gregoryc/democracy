Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
