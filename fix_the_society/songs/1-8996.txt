Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
