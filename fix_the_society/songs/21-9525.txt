Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
