Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
