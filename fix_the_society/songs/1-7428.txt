Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
