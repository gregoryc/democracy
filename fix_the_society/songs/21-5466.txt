Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
