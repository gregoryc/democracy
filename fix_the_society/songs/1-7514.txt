Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
