Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
