Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
