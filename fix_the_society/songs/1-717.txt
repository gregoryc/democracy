Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, you act like a kid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, you act like a kid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, you act like a kid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
