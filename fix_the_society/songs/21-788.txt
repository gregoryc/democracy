Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
