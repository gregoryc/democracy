Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
