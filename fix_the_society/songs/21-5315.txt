Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
