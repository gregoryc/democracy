Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
