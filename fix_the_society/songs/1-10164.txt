Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid

The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
