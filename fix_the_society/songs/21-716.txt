Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
