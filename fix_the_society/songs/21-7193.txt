Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
