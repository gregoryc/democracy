Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
