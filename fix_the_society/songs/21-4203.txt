Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
