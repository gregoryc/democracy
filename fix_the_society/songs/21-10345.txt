Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
