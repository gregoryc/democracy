Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
