Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
