Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
