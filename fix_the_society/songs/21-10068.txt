Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
