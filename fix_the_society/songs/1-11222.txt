Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They do junk, they do dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
