VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
