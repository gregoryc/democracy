Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
