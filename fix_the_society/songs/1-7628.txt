Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
