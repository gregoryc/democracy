Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Science is  fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Science is  fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
