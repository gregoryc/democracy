Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
