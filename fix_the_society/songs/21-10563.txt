Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
