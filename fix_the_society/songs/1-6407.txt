Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
