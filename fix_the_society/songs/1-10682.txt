Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

An open conversation, they always divert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
