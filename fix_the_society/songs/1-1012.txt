Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
