Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt

Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

No one will be unhurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

No one will be unhurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
