Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
