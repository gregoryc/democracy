Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

The state of science is, wholly inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
