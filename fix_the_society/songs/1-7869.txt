Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
