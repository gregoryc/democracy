Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
