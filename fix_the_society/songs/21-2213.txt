Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
