Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
