VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
