Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
