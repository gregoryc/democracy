Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
