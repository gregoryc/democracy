Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
