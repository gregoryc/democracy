Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
