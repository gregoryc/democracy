Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS
