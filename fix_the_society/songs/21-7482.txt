Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
