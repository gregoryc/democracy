Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
