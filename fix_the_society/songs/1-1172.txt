Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and crying like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
