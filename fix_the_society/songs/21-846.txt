Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
