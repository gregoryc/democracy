Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
