Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
