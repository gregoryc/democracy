Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
