Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
