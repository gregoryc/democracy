Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
