Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
