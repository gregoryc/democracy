Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
