Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is obvious, anyone can detect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
