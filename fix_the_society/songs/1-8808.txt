Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
