Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their own principles are something they do not respect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
