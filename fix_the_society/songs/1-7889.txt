Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
