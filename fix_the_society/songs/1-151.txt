Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
