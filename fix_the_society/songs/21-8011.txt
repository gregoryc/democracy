Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
