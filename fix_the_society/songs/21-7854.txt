Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
