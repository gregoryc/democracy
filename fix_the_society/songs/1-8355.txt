VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They can't alter anything, they are inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They can't alter anything, they are inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
