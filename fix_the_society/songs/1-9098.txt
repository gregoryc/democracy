Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
