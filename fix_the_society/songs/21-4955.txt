Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
