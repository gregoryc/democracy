VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They don't think, they act like a kid

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
