Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
