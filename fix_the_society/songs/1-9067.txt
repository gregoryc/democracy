Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
