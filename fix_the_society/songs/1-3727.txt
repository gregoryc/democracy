Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
