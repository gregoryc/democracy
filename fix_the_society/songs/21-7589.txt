Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
