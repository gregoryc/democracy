Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Running away from conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Running away from conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Running away from conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Running away from conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
