Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
