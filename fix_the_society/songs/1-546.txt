Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
