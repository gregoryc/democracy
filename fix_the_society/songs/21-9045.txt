Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
