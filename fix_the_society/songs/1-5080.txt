Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
