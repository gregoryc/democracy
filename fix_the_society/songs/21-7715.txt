Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
