Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
