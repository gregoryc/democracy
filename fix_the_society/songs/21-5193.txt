Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
