Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
