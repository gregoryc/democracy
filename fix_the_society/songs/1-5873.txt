Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
