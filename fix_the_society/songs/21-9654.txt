Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
