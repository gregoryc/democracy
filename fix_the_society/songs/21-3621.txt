Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
