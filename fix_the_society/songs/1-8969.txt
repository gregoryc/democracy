Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

This is too insidious for many to detect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
