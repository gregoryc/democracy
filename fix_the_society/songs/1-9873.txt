Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
