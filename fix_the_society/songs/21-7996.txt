Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
