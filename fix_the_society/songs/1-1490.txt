Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
I must speak here, I must interject

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
