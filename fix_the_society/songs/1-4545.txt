Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
