Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
