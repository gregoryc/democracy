Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
