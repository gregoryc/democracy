Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
