Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
