Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
