Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
