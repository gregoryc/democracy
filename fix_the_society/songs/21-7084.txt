Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
