Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
