Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
