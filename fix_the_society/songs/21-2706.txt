Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
