Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
