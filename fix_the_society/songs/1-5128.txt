Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is too insidious for many to detect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
