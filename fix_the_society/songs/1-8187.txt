VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
