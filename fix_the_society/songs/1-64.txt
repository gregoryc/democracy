Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
