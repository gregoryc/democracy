Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
