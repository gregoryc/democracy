Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
