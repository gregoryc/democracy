Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
