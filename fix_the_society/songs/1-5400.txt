Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
