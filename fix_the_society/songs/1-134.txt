Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
