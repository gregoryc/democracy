Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
