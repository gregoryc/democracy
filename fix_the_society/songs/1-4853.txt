Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
