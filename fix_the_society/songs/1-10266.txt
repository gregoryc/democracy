VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
