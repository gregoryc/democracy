Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
