Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
