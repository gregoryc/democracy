VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too insidious for many to detect

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
