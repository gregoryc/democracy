Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
