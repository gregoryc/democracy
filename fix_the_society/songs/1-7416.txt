Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They do junk, they do dirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
