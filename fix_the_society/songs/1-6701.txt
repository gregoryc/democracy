Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
