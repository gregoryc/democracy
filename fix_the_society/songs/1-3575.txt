Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
