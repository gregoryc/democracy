Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
