Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
