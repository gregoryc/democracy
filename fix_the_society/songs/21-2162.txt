Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
