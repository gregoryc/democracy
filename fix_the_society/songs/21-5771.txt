Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
