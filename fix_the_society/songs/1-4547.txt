Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
