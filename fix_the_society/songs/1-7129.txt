Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
