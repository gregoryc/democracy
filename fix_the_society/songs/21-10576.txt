Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
