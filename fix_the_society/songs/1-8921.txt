Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
