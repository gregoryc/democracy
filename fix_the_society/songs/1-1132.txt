Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
