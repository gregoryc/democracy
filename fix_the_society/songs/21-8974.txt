Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
