Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
