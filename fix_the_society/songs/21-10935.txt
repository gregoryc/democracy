Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
