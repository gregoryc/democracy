Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
