Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
