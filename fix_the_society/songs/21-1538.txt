Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
