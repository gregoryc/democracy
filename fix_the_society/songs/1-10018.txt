Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, they completely neglect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
