Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They can't alter anything, they are inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They can't alter anything, they are inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
