Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
