Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
