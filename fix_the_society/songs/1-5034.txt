Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Reason is what they want to discard

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Science is  fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
