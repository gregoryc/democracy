Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
