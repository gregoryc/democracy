Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
