Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
