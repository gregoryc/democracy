Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
