Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
