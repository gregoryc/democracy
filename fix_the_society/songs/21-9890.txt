Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
