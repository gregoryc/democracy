Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
