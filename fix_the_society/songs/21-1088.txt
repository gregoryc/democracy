Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
