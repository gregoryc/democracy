Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
