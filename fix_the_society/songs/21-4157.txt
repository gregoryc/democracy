Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
