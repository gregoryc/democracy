Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
