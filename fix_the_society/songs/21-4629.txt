Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
