Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
