Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
