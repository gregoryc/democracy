Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
