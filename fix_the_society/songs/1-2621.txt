Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They do junk, they do dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
