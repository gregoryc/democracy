Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
