Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
