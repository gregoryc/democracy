Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Don't have to do with ego or id
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
