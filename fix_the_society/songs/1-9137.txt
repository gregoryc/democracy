VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
