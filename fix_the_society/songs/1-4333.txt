Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
