Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
