Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
