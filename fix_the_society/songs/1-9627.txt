Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
