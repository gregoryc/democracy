Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
