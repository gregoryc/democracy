Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
