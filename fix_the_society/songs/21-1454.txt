Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
