Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
