Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
