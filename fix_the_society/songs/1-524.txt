Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
