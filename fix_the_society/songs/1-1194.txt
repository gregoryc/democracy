Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
