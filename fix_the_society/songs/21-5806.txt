Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
