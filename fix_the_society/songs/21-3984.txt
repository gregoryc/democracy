Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
