Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
