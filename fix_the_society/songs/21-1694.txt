Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
