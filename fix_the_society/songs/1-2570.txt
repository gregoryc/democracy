Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
