Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Playing only the worst card

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
