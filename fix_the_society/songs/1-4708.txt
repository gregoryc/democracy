Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and crying like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
