Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
