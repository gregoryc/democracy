Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
