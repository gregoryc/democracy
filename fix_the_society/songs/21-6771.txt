Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
