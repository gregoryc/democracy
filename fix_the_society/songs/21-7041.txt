Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
