Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
