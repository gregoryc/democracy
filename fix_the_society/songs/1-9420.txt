Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
