VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
