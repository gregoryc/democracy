Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
