Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
