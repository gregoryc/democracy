Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
