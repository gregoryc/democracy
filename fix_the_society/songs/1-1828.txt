Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
