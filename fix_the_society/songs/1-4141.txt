Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
