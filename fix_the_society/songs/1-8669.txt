VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
