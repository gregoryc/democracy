Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
