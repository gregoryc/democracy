Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior makes them charred

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
