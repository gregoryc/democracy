Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
