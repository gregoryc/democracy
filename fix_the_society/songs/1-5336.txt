Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
The society is the ones who hurt

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
