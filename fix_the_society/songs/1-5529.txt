Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave

They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
