Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
