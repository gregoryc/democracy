Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
