Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
