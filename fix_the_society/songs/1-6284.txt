Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
