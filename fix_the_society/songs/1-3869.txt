Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
