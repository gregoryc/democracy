Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
