Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
