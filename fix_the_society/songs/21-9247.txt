Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
