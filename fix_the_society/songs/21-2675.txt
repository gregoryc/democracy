Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
