VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
