Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
