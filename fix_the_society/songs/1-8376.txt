Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
