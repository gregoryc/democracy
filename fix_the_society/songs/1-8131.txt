Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
