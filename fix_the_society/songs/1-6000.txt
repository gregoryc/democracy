Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, they act like a kid

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, they act like a kid

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
