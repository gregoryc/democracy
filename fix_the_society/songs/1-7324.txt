Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
