Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
