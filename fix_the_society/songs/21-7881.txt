Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
