VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
