Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
