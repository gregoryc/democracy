Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
