Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
