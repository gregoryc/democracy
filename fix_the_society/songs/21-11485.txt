Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
