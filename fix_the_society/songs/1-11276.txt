Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Playing only the worst card
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card
