Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
