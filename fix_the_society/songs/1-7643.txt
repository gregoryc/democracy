Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
