Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
