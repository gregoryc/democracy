Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
