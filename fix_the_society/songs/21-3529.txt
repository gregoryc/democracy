Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
