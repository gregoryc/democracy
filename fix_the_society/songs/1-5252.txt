VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too insidious for many to detect

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
