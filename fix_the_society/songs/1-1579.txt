Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

The society itself, you completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

The society itself, you completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
