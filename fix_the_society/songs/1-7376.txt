Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
