Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
