Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
