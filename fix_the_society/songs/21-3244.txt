Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
