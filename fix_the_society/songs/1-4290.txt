Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
