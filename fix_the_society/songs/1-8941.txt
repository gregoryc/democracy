Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
