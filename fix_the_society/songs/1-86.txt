Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
