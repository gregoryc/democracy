Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
