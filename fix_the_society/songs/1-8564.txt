Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

An open conversation, they always divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
