Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
