Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
