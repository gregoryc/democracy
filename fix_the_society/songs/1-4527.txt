Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
