Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
