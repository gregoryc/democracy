Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
