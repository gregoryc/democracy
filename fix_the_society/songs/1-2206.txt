Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
