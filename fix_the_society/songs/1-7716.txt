Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
