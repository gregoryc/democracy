Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
