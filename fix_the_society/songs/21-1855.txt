Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
