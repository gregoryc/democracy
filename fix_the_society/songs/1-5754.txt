Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
I must speak here, I must interject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
