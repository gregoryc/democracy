Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
