Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
