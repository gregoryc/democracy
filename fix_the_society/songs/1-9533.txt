Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
