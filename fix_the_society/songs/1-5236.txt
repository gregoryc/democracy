Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
