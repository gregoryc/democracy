Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
