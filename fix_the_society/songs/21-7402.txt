Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
