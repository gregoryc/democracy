Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
