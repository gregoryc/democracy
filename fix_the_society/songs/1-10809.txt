Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
