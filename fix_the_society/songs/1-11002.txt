Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
