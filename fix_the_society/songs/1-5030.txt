Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
