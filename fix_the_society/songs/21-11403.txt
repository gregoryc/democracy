Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
