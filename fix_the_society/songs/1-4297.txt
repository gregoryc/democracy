Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
