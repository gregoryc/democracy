Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
