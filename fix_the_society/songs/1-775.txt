Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
