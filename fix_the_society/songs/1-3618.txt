Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
