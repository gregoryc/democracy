Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
