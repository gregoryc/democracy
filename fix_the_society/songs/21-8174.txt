Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
