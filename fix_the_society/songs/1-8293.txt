Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
