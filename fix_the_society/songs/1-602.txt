Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
