Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
