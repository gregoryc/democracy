Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
