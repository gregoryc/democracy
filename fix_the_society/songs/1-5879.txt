VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
