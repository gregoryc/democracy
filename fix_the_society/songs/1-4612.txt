Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
