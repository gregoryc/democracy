VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
