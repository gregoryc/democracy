Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
