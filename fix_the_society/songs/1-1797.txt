Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
