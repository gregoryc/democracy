Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
