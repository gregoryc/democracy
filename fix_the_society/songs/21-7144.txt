Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
