Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
