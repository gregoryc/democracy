Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
An open conversation, they always divert

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
