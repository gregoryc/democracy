Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
