Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect

The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect

The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
