Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
