Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
