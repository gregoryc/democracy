Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't think, they act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They do junk, they do dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
