Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
