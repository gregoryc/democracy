Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
