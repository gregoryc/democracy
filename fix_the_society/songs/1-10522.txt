Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This is plain, anyone can detect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This is plain, anyone can detect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This is plain, anyone can detect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This is plain, anyone can detect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
