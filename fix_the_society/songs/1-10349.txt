Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
