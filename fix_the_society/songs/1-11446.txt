Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and complaining like a kid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave

The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
