Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They have no genuine intention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
