Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
