Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
