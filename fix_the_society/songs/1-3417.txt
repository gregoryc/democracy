Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
