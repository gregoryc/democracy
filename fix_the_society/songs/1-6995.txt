Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
