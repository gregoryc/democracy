Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
