Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
