Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
