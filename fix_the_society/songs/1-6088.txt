Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

You don't think, they act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
