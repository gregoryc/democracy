Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
