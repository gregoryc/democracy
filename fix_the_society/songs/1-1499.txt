Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You make broad claims while acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
