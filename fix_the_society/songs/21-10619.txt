Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
