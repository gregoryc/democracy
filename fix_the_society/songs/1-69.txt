Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
